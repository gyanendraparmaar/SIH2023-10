        "articleBody": "BENGALURU: The Karnataka government on Friday organised a mega event of reading the Constitution's preamble as part of the 'International Day of Democracy' celebrations with tens of lakhs of people participating in the programme from India and abroad at the same time. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah led the celebrations, along with Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar and several other guests, by reading the preamble from the grand steps of 'Vidhan Soudha' here with a large number of children and others in front of them joining in unison. Addressing the gathering, Siddaramaiah said the Congress government has fulfilled four of the five 'guarantees' (pre-poll promises) and  walked the talk .  Protection of the Constitution is the duty of every citizen , the chief minister said. Karnataka Social Welfare Minister H C Mahadevappa had said on Wednesday that nearly 2.28 crore people from all walks of life within the country and abroad, have registered to read the Constitution's preamble.  From within the country and abroad, 2,27,81,894 people have made online registration. We had expected 5 or 10 lakh people to register, but this has become a movement,  he had said. Those from corporate, private, government and banking sectors, people from industries and NRIs from several countries have come forward to participate, and have registered, he added.  The intention is to make people, especially the youth understand the idea of the democracy and the Constitution, and thereby they know the main purpose of the preamble, to lead a life with dignity, freedom and equality,  Mahadevappa said. The Social Welfare department had said that anyone who wants to read the Constitution on the same day (September 15) and at the same time of the main event, and get a participation certificate issued by the Government of Karnataka, needs to register. On September 15, they can upload a video or picture of them reading the preamble, upon which they will be approved to download participation certificates from the same website, it said. The minister spoke about the importance of making it mandatory to read the preamble at all formal functions of the state government, besides all schools, colleges and educational institutions. Meanwhile, in view of the mega event, Bengaluru Traffic Police also issued an advisory suggesting diversions of vehicles to ensure smooth flow of traffic.",

        "articleBody": "Priyank Kharge, Karnataka's minister for information technology, biotechnology, rural development and panchayat raj, said the government needs to  reset  its policies to accommodate new technologies and sectors. I know the pain points this (startup) industry goes through,\u201d Kharge said in his keynote address at the ET Soonicorns Summit on Saturday.\u201cSometimes just because the government does not understand the technology, we panic and we ban it; we say your business is illegal,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe have a lot of examples, but a classic case is Ola, Uber and Rapido \u2026 They've often faced bans in different cities, just because we don't fully understand ride sharing. The minister referred to the 28% GST on online gaming firms as another example of a need for reset. We've not even bothered checking what is a game of skill or a game of chance; we've just come up with the policy just because we think certain things are bad without understanding them \u2026 Until we reset our policies, it is very difficult for new businesses to come up. The Soonicorns Summit saw participation from a range of startup executives and investors across sectors like software-as-a-service, spacetech, cleatech, mobility, artificial intelligence, logistics and parts manufacturing.The minister asked startups and industry executives to collaborate with the state government in its upskilling initiatives. The government would be open to bearing 50% of the cost involved, with industry and the candidates bearing 25% of the cost each, he added. Whenever I meet industry captains, startups, you always say that our engineers are unemployable, the skill sets are not good enough, the syllabus is primitive \u2026 We have formed a skill-advisory committee with industry, academia and government participation to ensure we are future-ready, and I am personally chairing this committee. We want to listen to the industry's needs,  Kharge said.The Karnataka government is expanding its centres of excellence to upskill people in sectors like cybersecurity, internet of things, agri-innovation, data science and artificial intelligence, semiconductors, aerospace, robotics, animation, VFX and gaming, the minister said.The government is also set to further bolster the Karnataka Innovations Authority and introduce a preferential public procurement policy.  Our intention is to one day give you a pilot, ensure your product is tested in a sandbox environment, and if it's good enough why can't we be your first customer,  the minister said.Need for rethinkThe event, focusing on startups that are likely to soon top $1 billion in valuation and become unicorns, hosted a number of panel discussions involving startup executives, investors, and other industry participants like bankers.In a discussion on the recent spate of governance issues at startups, Ritesh Banglani, partner at Stellaris Venture Partners, said investors are having to strike a fine balance.  We've started doing more reputational and ethical due diligence before investments now, but we can't do it every time because that would just take too long \u2026 in our experience, the majority of founders are ethical \u2026 we don't treat founders as potential criminals,  he said. Over the last two years, things changed a bit \u2026 but this (increased due diligence) is not something new, in fact I'd say it's a return to what was normal back in the day. So now we're very strict that this is the bare minimum diligence, and the bar cannot be lower,  said Swapna Gupta, partner at Avaana Capital.Talking in the same panel about startups going public, Abhishek Goyal, cofounder of Tracxn Technologies, said it improved the chances of long-term success.  Look at the largest firms on the planet, 90% of them are public \u2026 (after the IPO) we went from 30 shareholders to 30,000 shareholders overnight and the amount of responsibility that puts on your shoulders is great for your business \u2026 that kind of discipline can set you up for decades of growth. In another panel discussion, manufacturing startup Zetwerk's chief executive Amrit Acharya talked about the difficulty of raising a seed round in the manufacturing space, as many investors didn\u2019t understand the nature of his business. India continues to be in its golden era of manufacturing, and the company is looking to open manufacturing capacities not just in India but also the US, he said.At another panel discussion, Vishnu Rajeev, investment principal at Speciale Invest, talked about the difficulties in finding deeptech startups to invest in. \u201cWhen making investments in deeptech, three things matter a lot. First and foremost is the team; they must have the right set of scientific and engineering capabilities with the right mix of commercial capabilities \u2026 Then there is the technology that can move the needle. The third part is the market size. A deeptech investment needs to have large opportunities,\u201d he saidEthereal Machines founder and chief executive Kaushik Mudda said academia can play a role by telling freshers about a once-in-a-generational opportunity in the next couple of years.\u201cWith the 'China Plus One' idea, the government of India is pushing hard for manufacturing with 'Make in India' \u2026 The fresh new batches of engineers that are coming out need to be made aware of the importance of this for us to grow as a country. That is something only academia can instil,\u201d Mudda said.",

Debroy's opinion piece titled  There's a case for 'we the people' to embrace a new constitution  gathered attention as the EAC Chairman expressed that the Indian constitution is dated and carries colonial legacy while hinting at a 'new constitution'.  For me, the bedrock is the Constitution. Everything else follows. We no longer possess the one we inherited in 1950,  he opined.This is 2023, 73 years after 1950. Our current Constitution is largely based on the Government of India Act of 1935. In that sense, it is also a colonial legacy, he added.Debroy, 68, also took a snap at the governance in the country. Meanwhile, the economist questions the role of various entities involved in the governance. From Supreme Court to the Governor, the role is 'little' as per constitution, he says. Giving an exhaustive list of instances, Debroy, in his article expressed his opinion on the need for a new constitution. Much of what we debate begins and ends with the Constitution. A few amendments won't do. We should go back to the drawing board and start from first principles, asking what these words in the Preamble mean now: socialist, secular, democratic, justice, liberty and equality. We the People have to give ourselves a new Constitution,  Debroy wrote.EAC-PM is an independent body constituted to give advice on economic and related issues to Government of India, specifically to Prime Minister. The Council was reinstated in October 2021 with two full time members, Sanjeev Sanyal and Shamika Ravi. Its part-time members include Neelkant Mishra, Poonam Gupta and TT Ram Mohan.",

Their request was prompted by the tragic suicide of a 17-year-old girl student in Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh, leading to the arrest of a school principal and teacher.Bharat Arora, President of the action committee, expressed gratitude for the proactive step taken by the education authorities.The advisory highlighted the omnipresence of mobile phones in contemporary life and the potential adverse consequences of overreliance on these devices. It recognized that excessive smartphone use could contribute to various issues including depression, anxiety, social isolation, hyperactivity, hypertension, sleep deprivation, and impaired vision.DoE further argued that the use of mobile phones could adversely affect academic performance and potentially lead to incidents of bullying, harassment, and inappropriate content sharing. The advisory called for a collective effort from students, parents, teachers, and school heads to establish a consensus on limiting mobile phone usage in schools.Parents are instructed not to allow their children to carry phones to school, and in cases where students do bring phones, schools are directed to provide secure storage options like lockers for safekeeping. Mobile phones are explicitly prohibited in classrooms, laboratories, libraries, and playgrounds. Teachers and staff are also urged to refrain from using mobile phones during teaching and learning activities.This bold measure aims to curb distractions and foster a focused learning environment while also addressing potential negative consequences associated with unrestricted mobile phone use.",

A cumulative 419 crore LED bulbs and 151 crore LED tubelights have been distributed as on March 31, 2023 under the scheme. This has resulted in estimated saving of 176.19 billion units of electricity per annum, cost saving of Rs 70,477 crore per annum, avoided peak demand of 32.18 GW and 125 million tonnes of CO2 reduction annually, he added.",

        "description": "The recent release of the film 'Oppenheimer' brought the attention back to the disagreement between two key atomic bomb scientists involved in the Manhattan Project: J. Robert Oppenheimer and Lewis Strauss. Oppenheimer argued against developing a hydrogen bomb, while Strauss argued for it as a deterrent against the Soviet Union.",

        "articleBody": "J. Robert Oppenheimer's legacy as an American hero was fully restored last December, when the US government overturned its 1954 decision stripping him of his security clearance.Lewis Strauss, the man behind Oppenheimer's fall, remains covered in disgrace. In fact, 'Oppenheimer', the film, may have sealed his fate as a villain for history.Strauss (played by Robert Downey in 'Oppenheimer') passed away in 1974, and Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy) passed away in 1987.The two men had disagreed on hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer lobbied against it arguing atomic bombs are enough. Strauss argued for the thermonuclear bomb as a deterrent against the Soviet Union.Strauss, as a member of the Atomic Energy Commission, the top nuclear agency at the time, was opposing the decisive break during a congressional hearing on the export of isotopes.Oppenheimer did not only support it, but appeared to have mocked Strauss in his testimony as chairman of AEC's General Advisory Committee. He had said:  No one can force me to say that you cannot use these isotopes for atomic energy. You can use a shovel for atomic energy, in fact you do. You can use a bottle of beer for atomic energy, in fact you do. But to get some perspective, the fact is that during the war and after the war, these materials played no significant part, and in my knowledge, no part at all ... My own rating of the importance of isotopes in this broad sense is that they are far less important than electronic devices but far more important than, let us say, vitamins, somewhere in between. Strauss was enraged, enough to begin plotting to take down Oppenheimer.Oppenheimer's troubles, however, went back further. To the 1930s, in fact, when he flirted with left-wing causes while heading up a department on quantum mechanics the University of California, Berkeley, where he was before heading up the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos in New Mexico.He attended meetings of the Communist Party USA, whose members included his wife Katherine Oppenheimer Vissering (played by Emily Blunt in the Oppenheimer film), brother Frank Oppenheimer and his wife Jacquenette Yvonne Quann. FBI opened a file on him after he came on their radar as they were surveilling known members of the communist party.One of these contacts -- not his family -- pitched Oppenheimer an offer to pass over information to the Soviet Union when he was heading the Manhattan Project. He declined the offer.But a British scientist who had access to the Los Alamos project was actually spying for the Soviet Union and may have passed on critical information.The Soviet Union tested an atom bomb in 1949, four years after Oppenheimer-led Manhattan Projects first test of an atom bomb in July 1945. A few months later two of these bombs -- named Little Boy and Fat Man -- were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And he ended the second world war,At the peak of the a phase in US politic called the  second red scare , Oppenheimer was told by Strauss, who was now the chairman of the AEC, in late 1953 he had been stripped off his security clearance.Oppenheimer appealed, triggering a highly partisan hearing in which his lawyers were denied information available to the other side on grounds of their lack of clearance. At the end, Oppenheimer was held patriotic but untrustworthy.Strauss had had his victory.But a few years later, that sham hearing caught up with him and at the worst time in his career, when he was up for confirmation as President Dwight Eisenhower's nominee for secretary of commerce.He was rejected, primarily on the testimony of a scientist (played by Rami Malek) about Strauss' role in bringing down Oppenheimer.",

        "description": "On disruption of proceedings,Piyush Goyal, who is the Leader of the House in Rajya Sabha, told reporters in Parliament complex, that opposition parties are  running away  from a discussion on Manipur as they feel that incidents of  misbehavior  with women in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan may also come up.",

        "articleBody": "The government was ready for a discussion on the Manipur issue but the opposition disrupted proceedings, making it clear that it has made up its mind to not let Parliament function, Union Minister Piyush Goyal alleged on Thursday. Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha proceedings were adjourned for the day on the first day of the Monsoon session, amid slogan shouting and demands for a discussion on the situation in strife-hit Manipur. Even outside Parliament, opposition parties, including the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party and the Samajwadi Party, have slammed the BJP government at the Centre over the ethnic violence in Manipur and a May 4 video of two women being paraded naked in the northeastern state. On disruption of proceedings, Goyal, who is the Leader of the House in Rajya Sabha, told reporters in Parliament complex, that opposition parties are  running away  from a discussion on Manipur as they feel that incidents of  misbehavior  with women in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan may also come up.  The Congress and the rest of the opposition parties disrupted the House proceedings even though the government made it clear that it is ready for discussion. It became clear from the attitude of the opposition that they came, making up their mind, that they will not allow the House to function,  Goyal told reporters.  Perhaps there is something wrong in their heart. They are worried because there were incidents of violence (during panchayat polls) in Bengal and also there are unfortunate situations in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan,  the BJP leader said. While the Trinamool Congress is in power in West Bengal, the Congress has its governments in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, both of which go to assembly polls later this year. 101989806 Misbehaviour with women is happening in Congress-ruled states. Perhaps, they are running away from a discussion due to this,  Goyal said. When Rajya Sabha was in session, Goyal had said the government has no objections and was ready for a discussion. When the chairman allowed the notices for a short-duration discussion on Manipur, Congress president and Leader of Opposition in the House Mallikarjun Kharge raised objections and said all the business of the House be suspended first and their notices for a discussion on Manipur under Rule 267 be taken up. Rule 267 of the Upper House of Parliament pertains to suspension of rules. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi also hit out at the opposition and said,  Many of the opposition's members had given notice for short-duration discussion under Rule 176.   They had thought that we would not agree. We agreed for discussions. Then, they found another excuse to stall proceedings,  he said and added that  this is their attitude . Goyal alleged that the Congress and its  friends  also disrupted the business advisory committee meeting. This makes it clear that they want to stall proceedings  from today itself , he charged.  We also want to have a discussion on Manipur very sensitively. Everyone's view will come during the discussion... When discussions will be held, Home Minister (Amit Shah) will tell the House about discussions held on such topics in the past past. Who gave a reply and what was discussed (during past discussions). All these things will be placed before the House if discussion happens,  he said.  The government is ready for a discussion on Manipur but it is unfortunate that Congress, TMC and rest of the opposition parties are running away from it to perhaps hide themselves. They do not want to hold any discussion,  Goyal added. Tension mounted in the hills of Manipur after a May 4 video surfaced on Wednesday showing two women from one of the warring communities in Manipur being paraded naked by a mob from the other side. The Manipur Police on Thursday arrested one of the main accused who was seen in the video. Manipur has been witnessing ethnic clashes since May 3 between the majority Meitei community, concentrated in the Imphal valley, and the tribal Kukis, occupying the hills. Over 160 people have been killed in the violence so far. Before the start of the Monsoon session of Parliament on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the incident has shamed 140 crore Indians, asserting that law will act with its full might and no guilty will be spared. He requested all chief ministers to further strengthen law and order mechanism in their respective states, especially to protect women and to take most stringent action. Modi also mentioned states such as Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh while calling for boosting law and order, and protecting women.  I want to assure the people of the country that no guilty will be spared. What has happened to these daughters of Manipur can never be forgiven,  he said.  My heart is full of pain and anger,  Modi told reporters amid his criticism by opposition parties for not speaking on the ethnic violence in the northeastern state.",

The government is fast-tracking the hiring process and promotions of some existing officers (already 340 examiners were promoted as controllers earlier this week).  The government is also looking at legislative changes to fix timelines for patent grants/rejections, said Sanjeev Sanyal, a member of the PM's Economic Advisory Council, and a secretary to the government.  Supporting more manpower in the patents office, he said this is an office that is revenue positive unlike most of its peers in the government and so it makes sense to have more people and ease the process.   What we're looking is allowing pre-grant opposition, say for six months as in the US, before the final approval are granted/rejected, so that those who want to oppose the application can do so,  he told a seminar on intellectual property rights organized by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry here.  Sanyal said he is personally looking at drafting the urgently needed legislative changes as what is of critical importance is reforming the very process, and also fixing the legal metrology provisions, which now is a really cumbersome process, and  I am personally working on this now.   He said while over the past few years the efficiency of the system at the examiner level has gone up really high, at the more critical controller level it is stuck leading to massive pendency of applications which is around 1.7 lakh now.  Giving some comparative numbers, he said China, which is the world leader in both filing and granting patents, has over 13,700 people in its patents office, and the US, which is the second largest, has over 8,140, while India has just about 858 as of 2022.   But we are increasing the people strength massively now and by FY26 we will have 963 examiners and 998 controllers. In FY22, these numbers were 663 and 773 and in FY20 at 263 and 673, respectively.   On the rise in patents filing and according patents, he said as of FY23, the total number of filings touched 82,809 of which 52.3 per cent or 43,337 applications were from domestic companies and 39,472 were from foreign companies operating here. The domestic share was 37 per cent in FY20 and 44.4 per cent in FY22.  Data on the number of patents granted in FY23 are not available. In FY22 the number of patents granted stood at 34,153 from 82,805 filings and at 30,074 in the previous year from 66,400 filings. As against this, the numbers in China were 6.95 lakh and 15.85 lakh for FY22 and 3.27 lakh and 6.95 lakh in the US.",

The Adani Group has denied the allegations, which created a political firestorm and eroded his networth. The Adani junior has been named as the expert on the ports and SEZ sector in the 21-member body.  The name of Anant Ambani, the youngest son of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, appears next to the  diversified  sector in the list of the EAC members. Anant is the Executive Director of Reliance Industries.  An Economic Advisory Council as an Independent Body to advise the state government on economic and other related issues...,  the government resolution said. The council has domain experts from fields including textiles, pharma, ports, special economic zone, banking, agriculture, industries, engineering, and manufacturing. The EAC will advise the state government on any financial or other policy matter referred to it, address issues of macroeconomic importance and present the council's views to the government. Reacting to the GR, Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra Legislative Council Ambadas Danve, who belongs to the Uddhav Thackeray faction of Shiv Sena, has sarcastically said the state government should hand over the reins of power to Adani and others. The 21-member panel comprises a chairman, three full-time members (who are top officials of the state government), and 17 part-time members. Sanjiv Mehta, Chairman and Managing Director of Hindustan Unilever Ltd; SN Subramanyam, Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director, Larsen & Toubro; Milind Kamble Chairman, Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Ajit Ranade Vice Chancellor, Gokhale Institute Of Politics & Economics are part of the council. Senior bureaucrats O P Gupta Additional Chief Secretary, Finance Department, Harshdeep Kamble Principal Secretary, Industries Department, and Rajgopal Devara, Additional Chief Secretary, Planning Department, are also part of the panel. The notification said the role of the state of Maharashtra is crucial in the fulfillment of the objective to make India a USD 5 trillion economy. Accordingly, the goal of Maharashtra to become an economy of USD 1 trillion is intrinsically linked with the national goal and the collaboration of private and public sectors will help to achieve it. To study and determine parameters of key indicators in all sectors, as well as formulate strategies for growth in these sectors aligned with the objective of a  USD 1 trillion economy , involves extensive and in-depth consultation with various stakeholders in the state, the GR said stating the objective behind setting up the EAC. The EAC will suggest measures for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and determine parameters for important indicators in all sectors as well as to formulate strategies for growth in these sectors linked to the objective of USD 1 trillion. It will also submit the five-year plan document to the state government in accordance with the above mentioned matters.  Meanwhile, Ambadas Danve slammed the government in a tweet.   Instead of running the government for Ashar and Adani why don't you hand over this state government to them (sic),  he tweeted along with a page of the GR with the name of Karan Adani encircled.  The inclusion of Adani Group's Karan Adani in the Economic Advisor Council shows for whom the government is working. But this will not work in Maharashtra,  he added.",

        "articleBody": "The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) has suggested that the government should come up with substantive criteria and a detailed procedure for declaring monuments to be of national importance. In a report titled 'Monuments of National Importance - Urgent Need for Rationalisation', the EAC-PM pointed out that expenditure on the conservation and maintenance of monuments of national importance is inadequate.  Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) should come up with substantive criteria and a detailed procedure for declaring monuments to be of national importance.  It also should publish a book of notifications with detailed information about the provenance of all Monuments of National Importance (MNI),  the report said. India currently has 3,695 MNI that are under the protection of ASI. The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act (AMASR Act), 1958, (amended in 2010) provides for the declaration and conservation of ancient and historical monuments and archaeological sites and remains of national importance. The report prepared by EAC-PM member Sanjeev Sanyal has also recommended that the proceeds from these monuments should vest with the implementing bodies. As per the report, a large number of the present list of MNI were identified as such before 1947 under colonial-era laws. No attempts were made to comprehensively review the list after independence, it added. EAC-PM also recommended that minor monuments and antiquities protected as monuments should be denotified as MNI and monuments with local importance should be transferred to respective states for protection.  Allocation of funds for the protection of MNI should be increased,  the report said, adding that at the same time, revenue streams such as tickets, events, fees and other sources should be leveraged more proactively. The EAC-PM is of the view that an effort should be made to restore geographical balance in the list of MNI.  Along with rationalising the existing list, other monuments should be added to the list based on well-defined criteria and procedures,  it said. According to the report, around 75 British cemeteries/graves are considered as 'monuments of national importance'.  Also, various monuments declared as MNI are of local importance and do not necessarily have national significance per se,  the report said, adding that 24 monuments of national importance are untraceable.  The report pointed out that over 60 per cent of MNI are located in just 5 states - Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. While the city of Delhi alone has 173 MNI, states like Telangana(8), Bihar (70), and Odisha (80) have disproportionately fewer MNI, it noted. As per the report, the government had allocated Rs 428 crore for the upkeep and protection of 3,695 monuments, which is approximately Rs 11 lakh per MNI.  This is too little for a culturally rich and civilisational state like India. Therefore, there is an urgent need to exponentially increase the allocation of funds for the protection and upkeep of monuments,  the EAC-PM said.",

According to the EAC-PM, there is a need to comprehensively review the list of MNI to address the issue of selection errors, geographically skewed distribution of monuments and inadequate expenditure on protection of monuments. The EAC-PM is of the view that the separation of responsibilities between the Archaeological Survey of India (maintenance of monuments) and the National Monuments Authority (development of surrounding area) seems to not have worked. \u201cIt is advisable to merge these responsibilities and give them to NMA. The main ASI should focus only on archaeology research, excavation, restorations and maintenance of museums,\u201d it said, adding that NMA can function as an autonomous body under ASI.Once a monument or a site is declared to be of national importance, one-hundred-meter radius of the monument is then considered a \u2018prohibited area\u2019 where there is a ban on construction activities. Further 200 meters is considered a \u2018regulated area\u2019 where there are regulations on construction.",

However, on December 17, he cancelled this deal.Now, since the time barring period to issue credit note for the builder expires on November 30, therefore the builder would not refund this GST amount to the consumer and the consumer would lose the Rs 5 lakh of GST paid,\u201d said Vivek Jalan, partner, Tax Connect Advisory, a multidisciplinary consultancy firm.\u201cAmong the very few cases in the GST regime, the GST Council has decided that these consumers would directly get the refund from the government. The procedure regarding this would be set up in time to come,\u201d said Jalan.For supplies made in a financial year, the CGST law permits issuance of credit notes only by November 30 following the end of the previous financial year. Accordingly, if a flat was booked in March 2022 and cancelled in December 2022, issuance of credit note would not be permitted since the cancellation is after the deadline of November 30.\u201cAs opposed to that, under the GST law, an application for refund can be made within two years from the relevant date (date of payment of tax or receipt of services),\u201d said Harsh Shah, partner, Economic Laws Practice. \u201cThe only other option in this is claiming a refund, which could potentially be exercised by the supplier (developer). However, in terms of the principle of \u2018unjust enrichment\u2019, a developer can claim a refund only if the tax was refunded back to the customer.",

        "description": "New York City officials have evacuated homeless individuals from the area surrounding the United Nations headquarters ahead of the General Assembly session, aiming to keep them out of sight from visiting world leaders. This annual clearance operation highlights the city's ongoing challenges with homelessness and mental health issues. In addition to the removal of homeless individuals, security measures for the UN event include street closures around hotels where leaders will be staying. ",

        "articleBody": "City officials in New York have taken action to clear homeless individuals from the vicinity of the United Nations headquarters as preparations for the high-level General Assembly session get underway, with the aim of keeping them out of sight from visiting world leaders and enhancing security.The individuals, who have been residing in makeshift accommodations such as tarps, cardboard boxes, umbrellas, and construction sheds along First Avenue, the location of the UN, as well as Second Avenue and nearby streets, were evacuated by Sunday evening.This annual clearance operation reflects the ongoing challenges faced by the city, including a chronic housing crisis compounded by mental health issues, which place significant demands on the city's social services.In addition to the removal of homeless individuals, security measures for the UN event include the closure of many streets surrounding hotels where approximately 150 presidents and prime ministers will be lodging. These precautions not only serve security purposes but also shield VIPs from the sight of homelessness in the world's financial and media hub.While the removal of homeless individuals is linked to the UN event, New York City also periodically dismantles settlements established by impoverished residents.The responsibility of safeguarding the gathering of world leaders falls on the New York Police Department, which places an approximately 40-hectare area encompassing the UN headquarters under a virtual lockdown every September during the high-level meeting.During this period, those heading to the UN must pass through multiple security checkpoints manned by UN security personnel, police officers, and federal agents representing various agencies before reaching their destination. Residents and workers in the affected buildings are also subjected to heightened security measures.Overhead, police helicopters maintain surveillance, and police and Coast Guard boats patrol the East River behind the UN headquarters.The decision to implement riverine precautions was prompted by an incident in 1964 when anti-communist Cubans fired a bazooka at the UN from the opposite bank of the river while Fidel Castro's lieutenant, Che Guevara, was addressing the General Assembly. Fortunately, the attack missed its target.Although the recent removal of homeless individuals around the UN primarily serves security and cosmetic purposes, the city also periodically dismantles encampments established by its impoverished residents.Despite the city's obligation to provide proper housing for those displaced, an audit conducted by City Comptroller Brad Landler revealed that only three out of those forcibly removed from these sweeps received the promised hearing.As a result, the majority of individuals displaced in these operations, approximately 99.9%, remain homeless, according to Landler's statement to the National Public Radio network, a broadcaster that receives federal funding, in June.In 2022, reports indicate that over 1,500 encampments, each housing several individuals, were dismantled with the assistance of law enforcement.These encampments, often euphemistically referred to as settlements, consist of huts and tents set up on public or vacant land, under bridges, or overpasses by individuals experiencing poverty.",

Azam Khan was elected an MLA from the Rampur Sadar constituency. The state Assembly Secretariat, earlier in October, announced Khan's disqualification from the House after a court sentenced him to three years in jail in a hate speech case.The case was registered against Khan in April 2019 for levelling serious allegations against administrative officials posted in Rampur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath during an election meeting.During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Khan was booked for making inflammatory speeches while addressing a public meeting in Khatanagaria village of the Milak Kotwali area.Earlier, Allahabad High Court in May 2022 had granted interim bail to Azam Khan in a matter which was related to a wrongful possession of Waqf board property land. Azam Khan began his political career by winning the 1980 assembly election on Janata Party (Secular) ticket from Rampur. He has served as a minister in both Akhilesh Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav governments.As many as 81 cases have since been registered against the SP stalwart in Rampur on several charges including land grabbing, cheating, criminal trespass and hate speech.Khan's wife and ex-MP Tanzeen Fatima and their son and former MLA Abdullah Azam Khan have also been booked in at least 40 cases. All three are currently out on bail.Azam along with Tanzeen and Abdullah was arrested in February 2020 in a case of alleged forgery of the latter's birth certificate. Azam was released from jail in May 2022. Tanzeen was released from prison in December 2020 and Abdullah in January 2022. ",

Colonel Manpreet Singh, Commanding Officer of 19 Rashtriya Rifles, Major Ashish Dhonack, and Deputy Superintendent Humayun Bhat were killed in the gunfight with terrorists that ensued in Garol area of Anantnag district early Wednesday.  In a post on X, the Congress called the prime minister  insensitive  and shared videos of mourning family members of a deceased soldier and Prime Minister Modi being given a rousing welcome at the BJP headquarters on Wednesday evening following the successful G20 meeting under India's presidency.  In a post in Hindi on X, Congress media and publicity department head Pawan Khera said that at a time when the the sad news of the martyrdom of three officers of our army was coming, a  celebration was organized for Badshah  at the BJP headquarters.   No matter what happens, the Prime Minister cannot postpone receiving accolades,  he said.  Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said three officers of the police and the army were martyred in an encounter in Kashmir.   It breaks my heart to see pictures of their small children. And here the celebration hasn't stopped? He had not stopped shooting even after the martyrdom of 40 brave men in Pulwama. There is unimaginable insensitivity,  Shrinate said and shared pictures of the welcome at the BJP headquarters.  Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray faction) leader Priyanka Chaturvedi also shared the video of the rousing welcome accorded to the PM at the BJP headquarters, and said  this could have been postponed, expected more sensitivity, especially on a day when our security forces have fought a fierce fight with militants in Kashmir .  RJD leader Manoj Jha also slammed the BJP for organising the welcome programme for Prime Minister Modi and said the ruling party held  celebrations  at its headquarters even as three soldiers and a police officer were killed in a gunbattle with terrorists.   On a day when our Jawans were martyred, we were also watching celebrations at the BJP office. The nation was watching both visuals together,  Jha said.   At the time of Pulwama attack, they had said they got to know about it late... But this time they knew everything since morning. The ruling party and the Prime Minister were celebrating...

A team of 18 food safety officers has been diligently collecting samples of raw food items used in 19 five-star hotels located in New Delhi and the Aerocity area, specifically chosen to accommodate foreign guests during the summit. We conduct routine checks and sample collections, but given the significance of the G20 summit, we have deployed 18 food safety officers and initiated laboratory testing of the samples gathered from these hotels starting from Monday,  stated a senior department official.Scheduled to commence on September 9th, the two-day summit has already seen the arrival of several heads of state. A total of twenty-three five-star hotels have been designated for the dignitaries' stay, each subject to rigorous food safety scrutiny.The food safety officers are not limiting their inspection to just food items; they are also ensuring that kitchens and staff adhere to high standards of hygiene, including utensil cleaning. Furthermore, all cooked food will undergo meticulous monitoring and sampling for quality checks, conducted in collaboration with the local police.These food safety officers will inspect the cooking facilities and the procurement of raw food materials at various hotels. The raw food materials will only be used for cooking once the lab reports are obtained within 24 hours, as emphasized by the officer.No food items will be prepared or served in the hotel kitchens without undergoing a thorough lab test.Additionally, the food safety officers will maintain vigilance over the food served at banquets and other events associated with the summit. Typically, food sample reports take 15-20 days to arrive, but in this case, they will be expedited and made available within a few hours, the officer assured.Given the high-security environment surrounding the hotels where heads of state will reside, discussions and coordination have occurred with the city police regarding food item sampling. Police personnel have also been trained in the proper procedure for collecting samples of cooked food.This comprehensive approach extends to the sampling and testing of all food and beverages, including snacks and tea, to be served during banquets, high tea, breakfast, lunch, and dinner throughout the summit. The commitment of the Delhi Food Safety Department underscores the importance of ensuring the highest standards of food safety for the esteemed guests of the G20 summit.",

        "articleBody": "The Railway Board has directed the zonal railways to expeditiously dispose of pending requests of employees for transfer to the station or place of posting of their respective spouses. The communication to the principal chief personnel officers of 15 zones on August 17 came after the board received a number of representations from railway employees and their associations about delays or denial on their spouse ground transfer requests despite having a laid down policy.   It is requested that all such pending requests may be examined and disposed of in terms of laid down policy,  the letter stated, adding that the respective zones should apprise the board a summary of all pending and cleared requests along with reasons for the delay.  The board is of the view that after the digitisation process of Human Resource Management System (HRMS), such requests should not be pending for long.  On August 20 last year, the board issued a similar direction asking for  information pertaining to disposal of requests of transfer on spouse ground .  After coming to know that there were several spouse ground transfer requests pending, it directed the zones on September 6 last year to launch a special drive to dispose of all cases.  In its latest communication, the board has reiterated its direction and asked zones to bring to conclusion all new and old pending cases.  In March 2, 2010, the Ministry of Railways relaxed its policy of posting husband and wife at the same station keeping in view the need  to make concerted efforts to increase representation of women in central government jobs .  The policy took into consideration various working conditions such as the seniority status of husband and wife, employment status where one of the spouses may belong to another central service etc and suggested transfer options accordingly.  Several such spouses working at different stations claim that they deserve to be posted at the same place as per the laid down norms, but the departments concerned have kept their transfer requests on hold without any valid reason. Some of them have alleged that their transfer requests were denied without any valid reason.  On August 19 this year, the All India Train Controllers' Association wrote a letter to the principal chief operation manager of the Northern Railway alleging wrongful denial of spouse ground transfer requests of train controllers.   I would like to bring it to your notice that misinterpretation of Railway Board's guidelines by Personnel Department has caused trouble for train controllers who are desirous of inter-divisional/zonal transfer on reasonable and permitted grounds,  the officer-bearers of the association said in its letter.  Senior officers in the board are of the view that immediate disposal of such transfers help enable employees to lead a normal family life.",

        "description": "The Indian government plans to launch a nationwide campaign in November to promote submission of digital life certificates (DLCs) by pensioners. The Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has been promoting the use of DLCs (Jeevan Pramaan) among central government pensioners to provide them with a smoother process for pension continuation.

        "articleBody": "The Centre will launch a mega campaign in November to promote the submission of digital life certificate by pensioners, an official statement issued on Wednesday said. Submission of life certificates is an important activity to be carried out by pensioners every year in the month of November (with a special provision for pensioners aged 80 years and above to submit them in October) to ensure the continuity of their pension.  To enhance the 'ease of living' of central government pensioners, the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has been promoting digital life certificate (DLC) i.e. 'Jeevan Pramaan' extensively, it said.   With a view to spread awareness amongst all the central government pensioners as well as the pension disbursing authorities for the use of DLC/face authentication technology to submit digital life certificates, DoPPW launched a nationwide campaign in November 2022 in 37 cities throughout the country. The campaign was a huge success with more than 35 lakh DLCs of central government pensioners issued,  said the statement issued by the Personnel Ministry.  A similar campaign will now be held from November 1 to 30, 2023 in 100 cities across the country, targeting 50 lakh pensioners, it said.   To ensure the success of the campaign, so that the benefit of digital modes of life certificate submission reaches pensioners in the remotest corners of the country and also benefits super senior/sick /incapacitated pensioners, a comprehensive circular with detailed guidelines has been issued defining roles and responsibilities of all the stakeholders which includes ministries/ departments of the government of India, pension disbursing banks and pensioners' associations,  the statement said.  These guidelines include nomination of nodal officers by the stakeholders, for the campaign, spreading awareness/providing due publicity to DLC-face authentication technique through banners/posters placed strategically in offices and bank branches/ ATMs and equipping dedicated staff at bank branches with an Android phone to use this technology when pensioners visit the branch for submission of life certificate, it said.  The guidelines also mention holding camps to enable pensioners to submit their DLCs without delay and home visits in case of bedridden pensioners, the statement said.   In addition, pensioners' welfare associations have been sensitised to hold camps for pensioners for DLC submission. Teams from the department will also be visiting various locations throughout the country to assist pensioners in the use of various digital modes to submit their life certificates. Due publicity will be given through social media using Twitter, Facebook and videos on YouTube,  it added.  As per the face authentication facility, the identity of a person is established through the face recognition technique and DLC gets generated.   This breakthrough technology, launched in November 2021, reduced the dependence of pensioners on external biometric devices and made the process more accessible and affordable to masses by leveraging smartphone-based technology,  the statement said.",

        "articleBody": "Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Monday said that almost 2,000 promotions in Assistant Section Officer (ASO) and other grades are in process and are likely to be completed by this year-end. He stated this while meeting a delegation of central secretariat employees, including representatives of the Central Secretariat Service (CSS) forum and direct recruits of limited departmental competitive examination (LDCE), who had jointly called on the minister.  Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel, said that last year alone about 9,000 mass promotions were made and, prior to that, the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) granted 4,000 promotions in three years.  The minister said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is very keen that hardworking and performing officials should be provided with a work-friendly environment as well as timely service benefits so that they remain motivated to give in their best for nation-building.   The government led by Prime Minister Modi has been granting mass promotions to employees in order to motivate them and overcome the problem of long stagnation. Another 2,000 promotions in ASO and other grades are in process and hopefully, they will get promoted by this year-end,  Singh was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the Personnel Ministry.  The DoPT had last month approved the mass promotion of 1,592 officials working in the capacity of ASOs to the post of Section Officers (SOs) on an adhoc basis with immediate effect.  The minister said that in the last nine years, under the guidance of Prime Minister Modi, the government has periodically reviewed the longstanding stagnation issues in the various central ministries that are a legacy of the past due to pending court cases, lack of vacancies in higher grades and other personnel issues.  Singh said the government is concerned about long stagnation in certain cadres and at certain levels where some of the employees working in the lowest rung of the administration spend their entire service tenure of 30 to 35 years without getting a single promotion.  Singh regretted that in a large number of cases, stagnation in promotions was the result of litigations prompted by inappropriate decisions or twisting of rules to give out-of-turn promotions during the previous governments, the statement said.  In few of the 4,000 promotions cleared in recent years, the government granted promotions despite the cases being sub-judice, after consulting legal experts and making valid provisions for judicial scrutiny, he said.",

According to the DoPPW, the programme was held with a view to dispense information, understand issues faced by pensioners, and dwell on suggestions forwarded by them.  Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare has taken a number of initiatives towards improving pensioners' welfare which include digitisation of various pension related activities,  a statement issued by the personnel ministry said.  The department has taken steps to reach out to all pensioners through various modes and spread awareness about its initiatives, thus enabling all pensioners to use the benefits designed for them,  At present, the DoPPW has 50 pensioners' associations registered with it across the country. A meeting was held at Pune with members of two registered pensioners' associations -- All India Central Government Pensioners' Association and Defence Accounts Pensioners' Association -- for which V Srinivas, secretary, DoPPW and Sanjiv Narain Mathur, additional secretary, DoPPW, visited the city on Friday, it said. During the interaction, Srinivas apprised the associations' members of the various initiatives taken by the department, including holding of a nationwide digital life certificate campaign (DLC) and pension adalats for on-the-spot resolution of long-standing grievances among others. He also informed members about CPENGRAMS (Centralised Pension Grievances Redress And Monitoring System), an online grievance registration portal of the department. Srinivas talked about stronger collaboration with banks who are committed towards providing comfort to pensioners through timely and correct payment of pension. Sanjiv Narain Mathur shared the initiative of the department related to holding of a nationwide DLC campaign to reach out to pensioners in the remotest corners, with special emphasis on hospitalised and incapacitated pensioners. He said the nationwide DLC campaigns held in November 2022 at 37 locations across the country had enabled generation of more than 35 lakh DLCs of central government pensioners and a similar campaign is proposed to be held in November 2023 at 100 locations, in which pensioners' associations would be actively involved, being an extended arm of the department. Principal Controller of Defence Accounts, Rajiv Chavan said in order to make life of pensioners easier, all retirees should be made technologically aware before retirement with regard to use of devices such as smart phones. They should be sensitised about the benefits due to them, investment avenues, insurances and other such matters, Chavan said.",

He said that the promotion orders will be issued soon by the respective cadre controlling authorities.  Government has been granting mass promotions to employees to motivate them and overcome the problem of long stagnation. Another 2,000 promotions in ASO and other grades are in process and hopefully, they will get promoted by this year's end,  said Singh, the minister of state for personnel. The move assumes significance as the Central Secretariat Service (CSS) officers' association had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his intervention to ensure the promotion of ASOs to the grade of Section Officers.  The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), Ministry of Personnel, has approved the mass promotion of 1,592 officials working in the capacity of ASOs to the post of section officers on an ad-hoc basis with immediate effect,  Singh said. He said in the last nine years, under the guidance of Modi, the government has periodically reviewed the longstanding stagnation issues in various central ministries that are a legacy of the past due to pending court cases, lack of vacancies in higher grades and other personnel issues. The minister said, last year also about 9,000 mass promotions were made and before that, the DoPT granted 4,000 promotions in the preceding three years. Singh said he personally feels disturbed to come across cases where some of the employees working in the lowest rung of the administration spend their entire service tenure of 30 to 35 years without securing a single promotion. The minister said he has discussed the issue with all the senior officers in the personnel ministry and several innovative means have been evolved to avoid stagnation at the middle and lower rungs of the administration. Singh also regretted that in a large number of cases, stagnation in promotions was the result of litigation amongst the employees themselves and even though the DoPT tries its best to put forward its view in the court of law, the delay becomes inevitable, according to a personnel ministry statement.  PM Modi has made efforts to ensure that government jobs are available to the maximum extent possible. It is extremely painful and disheartening to see employees sometimes superannuating in the same grade as promotions remained stuck,  he added. The orders for mass promotion of these employees belonging to the CSS have been issued after several rounds of high-level meetings in the DoPT chaired by Singh in the last few months, the statement said. The minister said, even legal experts were consulted as some of the orders are subject to the outcome of pending writ petitions. To bring in the ease of governance as well as objectivity in empanelment, the government has, in the last nine years, improvised upon the procedures to ensure that there are no subjective preferences involved in carrying out the promotions.  Procedures have been made more hi-tech using sophisticated technology tools to minimise the human interface,  he added. Singh said that the Modi government has done away with more than 1,600 rules which were either obsolete or had become irrelevant with time.  All this is meant not only to ensure effective and timely delivery of outcomes for the public but also to enable the employees to perform to the best of their ability,  the minister said.",

A systematic attempt is being made to change the character of the civil services, particularly the IAS and the IPS, which, in our constitutional scheme, were uniquely intended to be a protective ring around the Constitution, unaffected by political changes, having an all-India perspective rather than a regional, parochial one and being secure enough to maintain an independent, nonpartisan outlook, without fear or favour, the letter said.",

        "articleBody": "Highlighting lateral recruitment and proposed changes in civil services deputation rules, a group of 82 former civil servants on Thursday wrote to President Droupadi Murmu raising concern over  systematic attempts  being made to change the character of civil services. In an open letter, they appealed to her to convey their concerns to the Union government and caution them that the attempt to change the character of the civil services is fraught with extreme danger and will  spell the death of the constitutional government in India . A systematic attempt is being made to change the character of the civil services, particularly the IAS and the IPS, which, in our constitutional scheme, were uniquely intended to be a protective ring around the Constitution, unaffected by political changes, having an all-India perspective rather than a regional, parochial one and being secure enough to maintain an independent, nonpartisan outlook, without fear or favour, the letter said.  It is in this context that we seek to approach you on a matter which, of late, is causing much concern to us and which we are duty bound to bring to your notice,  it said. Service rules are sought to be amended to compel central deputations without the consent of either the officers concerned or their state governments, effectively undermining the authority and control of chief ministers over their officers, the letter said.  This has disturbed the federal balance and left civil servants torn between conflicting loyalties, thereby weakening their ability to be impartial,  it read. The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) had in December 2021 proposed changes to the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954, that will take away the power of states to override the Centre's request for seeking the officers on central deputation, and had sought comments from the states and Union Territories on it. The existing rules allow mutual consultation over the central deputation of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers. No final decision has been taken yet in the matter. In the past, governments have permitted lateral recruitment at senior levels and many such officers have distinguished themselves, the letter said. Lately, however, there has been opacity in the recruitment process at mid-levels and concerns that candidates are being chosen based on their ideological predilections, it said. The consequences of this for the future of an independent civil service requires no comment, the letter said. The Centre has this month decided to recruit 20 private sector specialists as joint secretaries, directors, and deputy secretaries on contract basis in its 12 departments. The former bureaucrats said measures are being taken that threaten the unique federal design of the IAS and the IPS, which underlies Sardar Patel's vision of a permanent civil service that would both bind the country together and enable it to maintain a balance between the interests of the Union and the states.  There are noticeable attempts to pressure officers to show exclusive loyalty to the Union rather than to the parent state cadre to which they are allotted,  the letter said. On occasions, arbitrary departmental actions have been taken against those who refuse to do so, it alleged. Former foreign secretary Sujatha Singh, ex-UPSC member Parveen Talha, former IPS officer Maxwell Pereira and ex- social justice empowerment secretary Anita Agnihotri are among the 82 signatories to the letter.  The actions and words of some very senior functionaries of the central government increases our concern on the future of the civil service and the consequent danger to democracy in India,  the letter said.  In this context, we would like to mention that the National Security Advisor (NSA), while addressing IPS officers at their passing out function in 2021, had emphasised that they should treat civil society as the 'fourth generation of warfare, that can be subverted, suborned, divided and manipulated to hurt the interests of the nation',  it said. Such sentiments are  antithetical to any democratic dispensation  and aim at placing civil society in a position of conflict with the state, the letter claimed.  At a time when politics is leaning dangerously towards a centralised, authoritarian, national security state with a leadership seemingly amenable to abandoning, without demur, the fundamental principles on which our Constitution is based, it has become critical for citizens to ensure that institutions and systems like the civil services which can check this frightening erosion of constitutional values in the manner envisaged by the great Sardar are protected and strengthened,  the letter said. By virtue of their allegiance to the Constitution and not the government of the day, the all-India services, particularly the IAS and IPS, have a critical role to play, it said.  As the constitutional head of the republic, we appeal to you to convey our concerns to the Union government and caution them that this attempt to change the character of the civil services is fraught with extreme danger and, as Sardar Patel had warned many years ago, will spell the death of constitutional government in India,  it added.",

        "articleBody": "The personal information of 237,000 current and former federal government employees has been exposed in a data breach at the US Transportation Department (USDOT), sources briefed on the matter said on Friday. The breach hit systems for processing TRANServe transit benefits that reimburse government employees for some commuting costs. It was not clear if any of the personal information had been used for criminal purposes. USDOT notified Congress Friday in an email seen by Reuters that its initial investigation of the data breach has  isolated the breach to certain systems at the department used for administrative functions, such as employee transit benefits processing.   USDOT said in a statement to Reuters the breach did not affect any transportation safety systems. It did not say who might be responsible for the hack.  The department is investigating the breach and has frozen access to the transit benefit system until it has been secured and restored, it said.  The maximum benefit allowance is $280 per month for federal employee mass transit commuting costs. The breach impacted 114,000 current employees and 123,000 former employees. Federal employees and agencies have been target of hackers in the past. Two breaches at the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in 2014 and 2015 compromised sensitive data belonging to more than 22 million people, including 4.2 million current and federal employees along with fingerprint data of 5.6 million of those individuals. Suspected Russian hackers who used SolarWinds and Microsoft software to burrow into US federal agencies breached unclassified Justice Department networks and read emails at the Treasury, Commerce and Homeland Security departments. Nine federal agencies were breached, Reuters reported in 2021.  (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chris Reese, Cynthia Osterman and Diane Craft)",

Singh was addressing the press on the sidelines of the Pune-based Armed Forces Medical College's (AFMC)'s Platinum Jubilee celebrations. It is an ongoing process in which blood samples are being collected in a graded manner for archiving in the repository that is maintained at AFMC's Department of Forensic Medicine, he said.  What does DNA profiling mean? You take a drop of the blood of an individual, put it on a special filter paper, and store it in a repository. Later, if you want to identify that individual for some reason, such as an unfortunate accident, we can retrieve his sample from the repository and match it with the DNA recovered from the mortal remains,  Lt General Singh explained.  Dried blood spots on specialized filter paper of individuals (armed forces personnel) are stored in the Forensic Department at AFMC. So far, in 12 cases, mortal remains have been identified using this technology, including those who died in the crash of a helicopter carrying (CDS) General Bipin Rawat,  he said. Rawat was killed along with 13 others, including his wife, in a helicopter crash in Tamil Nadu's Nilgiris area on December 8. 2021. Speaking about the 'Doctor Pilot' project, Singh said the aim of the programme is for doctors to understand the problems faced by the pilots.  Previously, doctors would have proper training and become pilots, and now with this project being resurrected, they will continue (to receive the proper training ),  he said, adding the programme was stopped, but now, in a systematic way, it would be restarted.  As of now, two doctors each in the fighter, helicopter, and transport streams will be trained. Based on the feedback, the project it will evolve further,  Singh said. Addressing queries related to the preparedness of the AFMS for a possible resurgence of COVID-19, the DGAFMS said military hospitals are fully prepared with adequate manpower and equipment for such a situation. Singh asserted the AFMC will be accorded status of Institute of National Importance in the coming years. The Platinum Jubilee celebrations were attended by high-ranking officers and civilian dignitaries from across the country, with eminent medical professionals sharing their expertise through orations, panel discussions, and symposiums. Among the highlights was a panel discussion on 'Contributions of Alumni to AFMC and the way forward', which was held in hybrid mode, with panelists and participants from across the globe. The two-day event was successfully conducted under the guidance and patronage of Lt Gen Narendra Kotwal, Director and Commandant of AFMC, a defence release said. On the occasion, a 108-foot Tricolour was hoisted by Flag Foundation of India in the presence of its founder and former MP Naveen Jindal.",

        "description": "Government jobs in India have been the most preferred option for decades, considering their job security, improved pay structure, work-life balance, housing, medical benefits, and post-retirement benefits. The increased demand for these jobs is strikingly contrasted by the limited opportunities. Moreover, the increasing obsession with government jobs results in challenges, including long wait periods and huge competition for limited job openings. ",

        "articleBody": "\u201cEk bar sarkari naukri lag jaye beta, fir life set ho jayegi tumhari (Child, your life would be easier once you get a government job)\u201d. We all must have heard our parents express this opinion at some point in time, right? Some students might have joined a coaching centre during college days to prepare for entrance exams to a public sector job. For decades, government jobs have been acknowledged as the most comfortable and secure employment option . In addition, their popularity has increased in the current fiercely competitive employment sector.According to a report by the Department of Personnel and Training, over 22 crore applicants have applied for government jobs since 2014, and over 7.22 lakh have received permanent positions in the central government. These numbers also highlight the contrast between the limited number of seats available and the consistently increasing demand for these jobs. However, it\u2019s important to note that the campaigns and initiatives launched by the government \u2014 such as the Make in India scheme and the production-linked incentive schemes \u2014 aim to bridge this gap by generating more than 60 lakh jobs. So, what makes government jobs so alluring? Job security and stability \u2013 While layoffs are common in the private sector, job security is considered a big benefit in public sector jobs. In addition, businesses sometimes merge and in some rare cases even collapse, leading to potential job issues for many. This is not the case in public sector jobs.Improved pay structure \u2013 Another significant reason to consider is the pay structure. After the introduction of the 7th Pay Commission\u2019s recommendations, the salary a government employee gets, along with allowances \u2014 such as travel allowance, dearness allowance, children's education allowance and rent \u2014 actually make their jobs even more rewarding. Work hours and balance \u2013 Work hours are considered stable in most public sector jobs. However, it also depends on the role and responsibility. For instance, if you are interested in joining the police force, armed forces or the railways, you will have to abide by the work timings required to fulfil your responsibility. During the pandemic, we saw government healthcare practitioners and policemen function day and night, to help and support citizens. Housing and medical benefits \u2013 Some staff get quarters and that can help save money that can be invested elsewhere. In many cases, government employees are entitled to free treatment, medicines, consultations and hospitalisation, sometimes even at renowned hospitals. Many of these premium facilities are offered to their families also.Post-retirement benefits \u2013 Pension is another key benefit that attract people to government jobs. The amount paid as pension varies depending on factors such as your designation, the number of years you have worked and your pay during the last five years. In addition, retirement benefits like provident fund, gratuity and salary arrears help in attaining financial independence after retirement.Nation building - In some government jobs \u2014 such as the army, police, public administration or in enabling technology for citizen access \u2014 there is an associated pride and happiness in serving and helping the nation move forward. Many find this inspiring.But, the increasing obsession with government jobs is also a challenge. How?In India, some youngsters are obsessed with the idea of securing their life with a \u201csarkari naukri\u201d. Thousands of young people appear for central and state exams every year. It is not easy to pass these competitive exams with flying colours in the first attempt. Many spend years and years studying for these exams in the hope of passing them the next time.There have been reports of government job aspirants clearing the entrance exams but not receiving joining letters. Youngsters in many states wait till they can get a government job. This gets linked to the unemployment figures. According to the unemployment report published by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, the rate of unemployment for those in the age bracket of 20-24 stood at 41.9% in September 2022; it was 9.8% for those in the 25-29 years category. Yes, government jobs do offer safety and have other attractions. However, it should not become an obsession and lead to more unemployment. So, you need to move forward with a rational mindset and do what\u2019s best for your career growth. Experts recommend seeking professional career guidance to set yourself in the right direction.",

As many as 1,393 Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers did not file their asset details in the 2011 to 2022 period, according to a recent report of the Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice.   Keeping the wider ramifications of corruption in public administration in mind, the Committee recommends the central government to constitute a committee to examine the issue of non-submission of annual immovable property returns by public servants in detail,  said the report tabled in Parliament recently. The Committee said that DoPT should put a mechanism in place to check the veracity of the property return statement filed by public servants. It said India is a signatory to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) which mandates the state parties to establish and promote effective practices aimed at prevention of corruption. The Committee said DoPT is the nodal department for anti-corruption, including matters concerning UNCAC. The panel also took up the matter of posting of an All India Service (AIS)-Indian Foreign Service (IFS) couple at the same station and suggested framing of appropriate guidelines. It appreciated the Department of Personnel and Training for formulating guidelines for posting husband and wife, who are in government service, at the same station.  However, the Committee feels there is a lacuna in the policy which needs to be addressed. It is observed that DoPT's guidelines do not provide any relief to spouses where one of the spouses belongs to an All India Service and the other spouse belongs to the Indian Foreign Service,  said the report tabled in Parliament recently. The three All India Services are IAS, Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service.  The IFS does not have positions earmarked in the state governments except for postings in Regional Passport Offices and branch secretariats. Moreover, these positions are restricted to certain pay levels. Secondly, the AIS officer can opt for deputation but the rules require him/her to go back to the cadre for 'cooling off' period or in case of other exigencies,  the report said. Accordingly, the Committee recommended that appropriate guidelines be framed for AIS-IFS couples also.  The Department may further consider allocating the AIS officer to Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory (AGMUT) cadre and post him/her in Delhi or alternatively allocate him/her to the states contiguous to Delhi where the IFS officer remains posted for long periods to the extent possible so that the couple can remain posted at the same station,  it said.",

The move comes after the government said it was still receiving proposals for regularisation of the period of overstay beyond the approved term of deputation.  In the latest order, the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has asked all central government ministries and departments to review the status of all the deputation cases and avoid delayed closure of cases involving overstay beyond the approved term of deputation in favour of delinquent officials.   The deputationist officer, including those who are presently on deputation, would be deemed to have been relieved on the date of expiry of the deputation period unless the competent authority has with requisite approvals, extended the period of deputation, in writing, prior to the date of its expiry,  it said.  It will be the responsibility of the immediate superior officer to ensure that the deputationist does not overstay, the order said.   In the event of the officer overstaying for any reason whatsoever, he or she is liable to disciplinary action and other adverse civil service consequences which would include the period of unauthorised overstay not being counted as qualifying service for the purpose of pension and that any increment due during the period of unauthorised overstay being deferred with cumulative effect, till the date on which the officer rejoins his parent cadre,  the DoPT said, reiterating its earlier directives in this regard.  The government said it is primarily the responsibility of the borrowing organisations to ensure that deputationists are relieved on the date of expiry of their deputation tenure.   Any proposal for extension of the tenure of deputation under rules should be initiated sufficiently before the expiry of the tenure. Besides, the responsibility rests with the deputationist and the lending organisations as well, to bring to the notice of the borrowing organisation about the expiry of the deputation tenure,  the DoPT said, seeking  strict compliance  with its order dated March 22.  It said the powers to extend the tenure of deputation, where absolutely necessary in the public interest, to the borrowing organisations up to a period not exceeding seven years at a stretch with the approval of the minister of their administrative ministry or department concerned.   However, in spite of relaxation allowed in the provisions governing tenure of deputation or foreign service, proposals continue to be received in this department for regularisation of the period of overstay beyond the approved term of deputation,  the DoPT said.",

He first came to India during the 2021 farmer protests and later after the death of Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu, more famously known as Sidhu Moosewale, in 2022. He is the chief patron of WPD and started Amrit Sanchar to wean away youths from drugs. Police claim that in the garb of a de-addiction campaign, he started a campaign, Khalsa Veer, to strengthen his organisation by going to villages. He stormed a police station in Ajnala, on February 24 to secure release of his associate, Lovepreet Toofan, who, according to him. was falsely implicated by the police. The police had to release Toofan and could not take action against the mob. Police claimed that Singh deliberately put Bir of Guru Grant Sahib in a minibus during the Ajnala incident, preventing police from acting.On March 18, the police initiated a crackdown against WPD and claimed that Singh might be involved in anti-national activities. A large number of Sikhs, however, did not believe the police version and suspected that Singh might be in the custody of police. This forced the police to release videos and route of Singh's escape which so far has been tracked to Haryana.  Bhai Amritpal was only trying to wean away youths from drugs. He was protesting against wrongful arrest at Ajnala. There is a tacit support for him across Punjab among youths and those outside Punjab (diaspora),  said Daljeet Singh, a resident of Jalandhar. Following the arrest of 200 suspects, the opposition mounted an attack on the Punjab government and police on targeting innocent youths. The police later clarified that only 30 persons have been charged with criminal cases while the rest are under preventive detention.Role of Khalistan 2.0The NIA said that the arrest of Kulwinder Singh by NIA led to revelation of the role of Harwinder Singh Sandhu aka Rinda, originally from Tarn Taran, who migrated to Nanded in Maharashtra after committing crimes in Punjab. Later he crossed the Nepal border and got shelter in Pakistan due to proximity with BKI chief Wadhawa Singh Babbar. The Mohali attack was planned in Pakistan but Rinda was communicating not with his Punjab gangsters, but gangsters of Canada, for deniability of Pakistani handlers, according to the NIA. The Punjab Police said its investigation found involvement of Nishan Singh, a resident of Tarn Taran whose foreign handler is Lakhbir Singh Landa, a history sheeter, currently staying in Canada. Landa arranged the safe house, arms and ammunition for the Mohali attack, according to the police.Ahead of Khanpuria's arrest, the Delhi Police's Special Cell nabbed four sharpshooters of the module in September-October 2022 last year. Two of them, Harmender Singh and Sukhdev, revealed that they coordinated several drone droppings of arms and ammunition, according to the police. It said the supply chain of arms consignment run by Rinda was meant to ensure supplies to the Lowrence Bishnoi gang, the Davinder Bambiha syndicate and also criminals who operated independently. The case was later transferred to the NIA which charge-sheeted Lawrence Bishnoi, Goldy Brar and 12 others on Friday. The total number of suspects in this terrorist-gangster nexus stands at 26, as per the NIA. The agency said in its charge-sheet that it had unearthed another module of narco-terrorists where one person Dharminder Singh was found to have links with Pakistan based Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) chief Harmeet Singh and Dubai based drug smuggler Jasmeet Singh Hakimzada in running drug trafficking in Punjab. The Taliban-Pakistan network coupled with Khalistani groups active in UK, Canada, Germany, US and Australia are increasingly using the drug trade to ramp up the Khalistani cause, it said.Punjab Police's TroublesThe Punjab Police was at the forefront of battling pro-Khalistan militancy in the 1980s and the first half of 1990s. After 2015, a series of sacrilegious incidents took place. In one of them, police opened fire, leading to the death of two Sikh protestors, after which a probe against the policemen was initiated. Last month, the Punjab Police's special investigation team (SIT) filed a charge-sheet in first information reports (FIRs) registered in 2015 and 2018 in the Kotkapura firing case, naming then Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, his deputy and son Sukhbir Badal, and then state police chief Sumedh Singh Saini among seven key accused. A few police officers were also named, including the then Ludhiana commissioner Param Raj Umranangal, the then deputy inspector general Amar Singh Chahal and the then Faridkot senior superintendent police (SSP) Sukhmander Singh Mann.The inaction against the protestors at Ajnala might be a reason no senior policeman wants to face action later when the regime changes. Punjab cops were caught on the wrong side during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's security lapse amid political uncertainty in the state. Recently, top Punjab Police officials were slapped with major penalties, including dismissal, demotion and reduction in pension and many were asked to explain why disciplinary proceedings should not be initiated against them as recommended by a Supreme Court committee that probed the breach of security during the PM's visit to the state on January 5 last year.Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann had ordered the state's personnel department to initiate disciplinary proceedings for major penalty against S Chattopadhyaya (former director general police or DGP) and other senior police officers.The crackdown on Amritpal Singh and WPD may have lifted the morale of Punjab Police but his arrest could give it a significant boost, according to people aware of the matter.",

        "articleBody": "Issues pertaining to the proposed bilateral investment treaty being negotiated between India and the UK along with a free trade agreement will figure prominently during the visit of a high-level team from Britain here, an official said. UK Secretary of State for Business and Trade Kemi Badenoch and Director General for Trade Negotiations at the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) Amanda Brooks are visiting India this week.  Besides participating in the G20 Trade and Investment Ministerial Meeting in Jaipur on August 24-25, the UK minister will hold bilateral talks with Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on August 26 here and review the progress of talks on the free trade agreement.  The UK minister is also expected to meet Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on various issues, including the bilateral investment treaty.  Brooks would also meet senior officials of the department of economic affairs in the finance ministry, which is leading the negotiations on the investment treaty.  These meetings assume significance as negotiations for the free trade agreement have reached a final stage. Investment treaty is being negotiated as a separate agreement between India and the UK and the two countries are looking at signing both the agreements simultaneously.  Though talks for most of the chapters have been closed, both sides have intensified negotiations to iron out differences on issues including rules of origin, intellectual property rights and the investment pact.  Sources said that at present the investment treaty is a hurdle in the conclusion of both the agreements simultaneously, however, negotiations are going on to bridge the differences.  These investment treaties help in promoting and protecting investments in each other's countries. The main point of contention involved in this pact is about the mechanism for the settlement of disputes.  India has proposed to first utilise all local judicial remedies for settlement of disputes before initiating an international arbitration.  India has earlier lost two international arbitration cases against British telecom giant Vodafone and Cairn Energy plc of the UK over the retrospective levy of taxes.  On automobiles and whiskey, an important demand of the UK, India has agreed to give duty concessions to British industry. Popular British whiskey brands include Johnnie Walker, Black Label and Chivas Regal.  To provide duty concessions in the automobile sector, several rounds of consultations have been held with the domestic players in India. According to an expert, the UK-based auto makers like JLR, Bentley, Rolls-Royce, and Aston Martin, cater to the luxury segment, while Indian manufacturers are mostly in the mass segment.  The 12th round of talks between India and the UK is in progress here. Out of the total 26 chapters in the proposed FTA, 19 have been closed. Investment is being negotiated as a separate agreement (bilateral investment treaty) between India and the UK.  The Indian industry is demanding greater access for its skilled professionals from sectors like IT, and healthcare in the UK market, besides market access for several goods at nil customs duties.  On the other hand, the UK is seeking a significant cut in import duties on goods such as scotch whiskey, automobiles, lamb meat, and certain confectionary items.  Britain is also looking for more opportunities for UK services in Indian markets in segments such as telecommunications, legal and financial services like banking. The bilateral trade between the countries increased to USD 20.36 billion in 2022-23 from USD 17.5 billion in 2021-22.",

Additional District Judge (ADJ) Ruchika Singla was hearing a criminal complaint filed by BJP leader Vinay Kumar Singh seeking to restrain them from publishing or broadcasting a documentary on the 2002 Gujarat riots or any other material defamatory to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP).   It is clear that as per the rules formulated under the Hague Convention and by the Government of India, the summons/notices in foreign countries can be effected only through the Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India, which has admittedly not been done in the present case,  the judge said.   Hence, it is directed that the summons be issued afresh to the defendants (BBC, Wikimedia Foundation and Internet Archive) on the filing of process fee within seven days to be served through the Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice as per rules,  ADJ Singla added.  Earlier, after being summoned by the court, BBC and Wikimedia Foundation raised objections, saying that the service of summons was not proper as both were foreign entities based in the UK and the US respectively.  They said according to the Hague Convention, the service upon a foreign entity had to be served through the prescribed rules.  Noting that the BBC was a public service broadcaster headquartered in London, the court said the plaintiff (Singh) cannot take the plea that it is an Indian entity.  The court also noted a circular from the Delhi High Court, dated September 13, 2011, where it referred to an office memorandum issued by the Union Ministry of Law and Justice, Department of Legal Affairs (Judicial Section), dated August 18, 2011, which directed that the service of summons or notices in foreign countries shall be under the provisions of the Hague Convention.  According to the provisions, such summons or notices could only be served through the ministry's Department of Legal Affairs, the court noted.   As the defendants are foreign entities, the service must be effected as per the guidelines issued by the Delhi High Court...,  the court said.  The court also rejected the argument that as the defendants have already engaged their counsels, who had appeared in the court, the service was deemed to be effected, and that the plea of improper service cannot be taken at the present stage.  It said the mere filing of the 'vakalatnama' by the counsel cannot do away with the mandatory requirement of the service of the summons upon the defendant under the prescribed procedure.

The activists, who fled Hong Kong following the imposition of the law, are accused of crimes such as subversion and colluding with foreign forces. The bounties have been criticized by the US, UK, and Australia, and Lee has called on the public to assist police in locating the activists. ",

        "articleBody": "Hong Kong's leader has called on eight overseas activists to turn themselves in a day after police put out bounties on them for violating the city's national security law. Police on Monday offered rewards of HK$1 million ($128,000) each for information leading to the arrests of eight prominent democracy activists based abroad, accusing them of crimes such as subversion and colluding with foreign forces. City leader John Lee said Tuesday that he supported the police action and called on the activists to surrender themselves.  The only way to end their destiny of being an abscondee who will be pursued for life is to surrender,  Lee told reporters, adding they would otherwise  spend their days in fear . All eight fled Hong Kong after Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on the financial hub in 2020 to quell dissent after huge, sometimes violent pro-democracy protests in 2019 were quashed.  Lee called on the public to assist police, adding that even the activists'  relatives and friends  could become informants. The offer has been criticised by the United States, Britain and Australia -- countries where the wanted activists reportedly reside. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller condemned the bounties as part of China's  transnational repression efforts  and called for their withdrawal.  The extraterritorial application of the Beijing-imposed National Security Law is a dangerous precedent that threatens the human rights and fundamental freedoms of people all over the world,  he added. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, meanwhile, said her government was  deeply disappointed  by the bounties.  We have consistently expressed concerns about the broad application of the National Security Law to arrest or pressure pro-democracy figures and civil society,  Wong said Tuesday. Britain will  not tolerate any attempts by China to intimidate and silence individuals in the UK and overseas , said UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly.   The UK will always defend the universal right to freedom of expression and stand up for those who are targeted.  Following Cleverly's statements, the Chinese embassy in London said Britain had interfered with China's internal affairs by  openly (offering) protection for fugitives .  This is crude interference in Hong Kong's rule of law and China's internal affairs,  they said.  China expresses strong dissatisfaction and firmly opposes this.  Asked about the criticism abroad, Hong Kong leader Lee said the city was not unique in having a national security law that was enforceable internationally.  I'm not afraid of any political pressure that is put on us, because we do what we believe is right,  Lee said.'I am not afraid' -  Since it was enacted three years ago, Hong Kong's national security law has led to the shutdown of scores of civil society groups, political parties and pro-democracy media outlets. It has also weakened the firewall that once separated Hong Kong's legal system from that of mainland China. Police have so far arrested 260 people under the national security law, with 79 of them convicted or awaiting sentencing.  While the law applies to people outside of the city, officials have not specified how enforcement is possible. The eight wanted activists include former pro-democracy lawmakers Nathan Law, Ted Hui and Dennis Kwok.  Veteran unionist Mung Siu-tat is also among the wanted as are activists Elmer Yuen, Finn Lau, Anna Kwok and Kevin Yam. Kwok told AFP the bounties may indirectly lead to threats against those on the wanted list.  (The authorities) want pro-Beijing members of the general public to be driven by populism and to bring us inconveniences or even physical threats,  she said. But Kwok said,  I am not afraid .  Actually, what they did makes me see even more clearly that what I have been doing is right.  The other activists were equally defiant.   I am just a Hong Konger who speaks out for Hong Kongers,  Nathan Law wrote on Twitter Monday.  We should not limit ourselves, self-censor, be intimidated, or live in fear. ",

He also stressed on the need to have equitable access to justice for all citizens.  Meghwal made these remarks while addressing a 'Chintan Shivir' of Department of Legal Affairs and Legislative Department of the Law Ministry.  While the legal affairs department advises the government on complex legal issues, the legislative department drafts bills for various ministries and vets key policy documents and ordinances.  Over 1,400 redundant laws have been scrapped by the Modi government so far through repeal bills brought in Parliament.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said recently that laws should be written in simple language so that even the poorest of the poor can understand the new legislation.   He (Meghwal) reiterated his dedication to advancing ongoing initiatives and ensuring equitable access to justice for all citizens. Emphasising the need to repeal outdated laws and simplify complex ones, he expressed his commitment to relieving the burden on the courts through these endeavours,  a law ministry statement said.",

The panel will aim to reduce the burden on courts, with decisions made through party-driven arbitration rather than expensive legal processes, and will also compare India's procedures with other foreign jurisdictions.

        "articleBody": "Amid a push for making India a hub for international arbitration, the government has set up an expert panel led by former law secretary T K Vishwanathan to recommend reforms in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act with an aim to reduce the burden on courts. Attorney General N Venkataramani is also part of the expert committee set up by the Department of Legal Affairs in the Union law ministry.  Law ministry additional secretary Rajiv Mani, some senior advocates, representatives of private law firms, and officials of the Legislative Department, Niti Aayog, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), railways and Central Public Works Department (CPWD) are its other members.  According to the terms of reference for the committee, it will evaluate and analyse the operation of the present arbitration ecosystem of the country, including the working of the Arbitration Act, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses and challenges vis-a-vis other important foreign jurisdictions.  The panel has to submit its report within 30 days, the office memorandum issued on Wednesday stated.  The committee has also been asked to recommend a framework of model arbitration system which is efficient, effective and economical and caters to the requirements of the users.  The panel will also devise strategy for developing a competitive environment in the arbitration services market for domestic and international parties that can subserve the interests of the users, particularly in building a regime of cost-effective arbitration.  Under arbitration, the parties concerned, instead of approaching courts, opt for private dispute resolution through arbitrators. The decision of arbitrators is binding.  The Department of Legal Affairs, the office memorandum said, is taking several steps to strengthen the dispute resolution environment in the country and promoting ease of doing business through reforms in laws from time to time.  As a part of continuous endeavour in this direction, the department is considering the need to further reform the working of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996.  The prime reason for the exercise is guided with a view to reduce court intervention in the whole process to the minimum and make arbitration a truly party-driven process, cost-effective and with time-bound finality being attached to the award, it said.",

The matter came to light in March when these students applied for permanent residency in Canada.In a statement, Dhaliwal said most of these students belong to Punjab and they will be assisted by lawyers who are experts in immigration laws in Canada.Besides, Dhaliwal has also written to all MPs of Punjab origin in Canada to solve the issue of these students so that the future of the children can be secured.On Tuesday, Dhaliwal had sought intervention of External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in the matter.Presiding over a meeting with civil and police officers associated with the NRI department here, Dhaliwal issued instructions to all deputy commissioners and senior superintendents of police to scrutinize documents of travel agents and immigration agencies and send a report by July 10.He expressed concern that many travel agents are running immigration agencies illegally.Dhaliwal said Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has already given clear instructions to improve the system.He said if the system is transparent and clean, then there will be less scope for human trafficking by illegal travel and immigration agencies.A special campaign against fake travel agents and immigration agencies would soon be launched in Punjab so that nobody could be involved in human trafficking, he said.Dhaliwal also said in the last 10 years, if any immigrant Punjabi has been deliberately implicated in a wrong case, then it should be brought to the government's attention.Such cases will be investigated and the victims will get justice, he said.He further said NRI meetings will be held for the first time in those villages of Punjab whose immigrants have done good work in their villages or earned the name at the national or international level.Dhaliwal also said that the NRI meetings will be held at the district level from July 15 to August 30.He invited all NRI Punjabis to come with their problems during such meetings and efforts will be made to solve them on the spot.He instructed police and civil officials that the grievances of the migrant Punjabis, which have not been resolved so far, should be settled by June 30.A total of 609 complaints were received in the first NRI meeting, out of which 522 have been resolved while 87 complaints are pending, the statement said.Dhaliwal also said there is a plan to bring a new NRI policy by September 30 to resolve all kinds of problems and complaints of NRI Punjabis.with PTI inputs",

In a letter to the department of pharmaceuticals (DOP), the department of consumer affairs has asked that medical devices are required to make these declarations in the interest of consumers.According to the letter which calls for enforcement of provisions of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009 and the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 on medical devices, the plain and conspicuous mandatory declarations are required under the rules in the interest of consumers, it said.It also informed the department that it was mandatory under the provisions of Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 that every packaged commodity including the medical devices should bear such details on them or on a label securely affixed.  The provisions require only the declaration of mandatory information including retail sales price in the form of MRP, country of origin, size and dimensions of the commodity where the sizes of the commodity in the package are relevant, unit sale price and consumer care details, on the pre-packaged commodities based on which the consumer can take an informed decision,  it saidThe provisions are applicable on indigenously manufactured as well as imported medical devices.Earlier the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMeD), Association of Diagnostic Manufacturers of India (ADMI), and Surgical Dressings Manufacturers Association of India (SDMAI) represented that the ministry of health and CDSCO can amend Drugs & Cosmetics Act & Medical Device Rules, 2012 to harmonise labelling requirements with packaged commodities rules.These associations had requested that enforcement of Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 and right to regulate by DoCA (department of consumer affairs) should continue to be maintained as consumer protection requirements (under Packaged Commodities Rules) are complementary to patient safety/protection requirements (under MDR) and one cannot always be substitute for the other. The enforcement provisions are made under the Legal Metrology Act/ Packaged Commodities Rules for various offenses including selling over and above MRP in hospitals and retail premises or on ecommerce platforms, altering MRP or other declarations/ without declarations etc. to ensure the consumer rights. The provisions of the Legal Metrology Act are also applicable on sale of products in loose or without packaging and sale through ecommerce websites in the interest of consumers,  itsaid.",

        "articleBody": "Today is the World Metrology Day, which commemorates the signing of the Metre Convention in 1875. This treaty established the International System of Units (SI), the most widely used system of measurement. The convention set the framework for global collaboration in the science of measurement.Metrology is the main pillar of quality infrastructure, essential for science, engineering, manufacturing, trade and healthcare. The theme for this year is 'Measurements supporting the global food system', aptly chosen in view of the increasing challenges of global food- supply chains caused by climate change.In India, metrology is administered through the Legal Metrology Act 2009, which functions as a measure to regulate the standards of weights and measures used in trade and commerce. Its aim is to protect consumers from non- standard, false or misleading trade descriptions while providing assurance of correct quantity of goods purchased. The Act also streamlines the measurement standards used in the country and aligns these with international standards.Everyday, crores of consumers across the country buy a multitude of goods to fulfil their daily needs. Whether it is toothpaste, a packet of milk, vegetables, fruit, bread, medicines or fuel, they are assured about the quantity in most transactions because of the trust built through a robust framework of legal metrology. Imagine a consumer measuring and weighing everything that she purchases, whether a litre of milk or 500 gm of sugar or 10 litres of petrol.In India, the history of measurement systems dates back to early Indus Valley Civilisation. During the Maurya empire (322-185 BCE), a comprehensive system of weights and measures was adopted with regulations for the usage. Interestingly, in the Manusmriti, one of the duties of the king was to 'examine the weights and balances every six months to ensure true measurements and to mark them with the royal stamp'.It is quite a challenge for government agencies to strike a balance between the facilitation of ease of doing business and protecting the interest of the consumers. While excessive criminal provisions can deter investor confidence, a lax regime can damage the consumer trust in quantity assurance. The department of consumer affairs (DCA) walked the tightrope and extensively engaged with all stakeholders, including representatives of state governments, trade, industry, business and voluntary consumer organisations, to arrive at a consensus on decriminalising many provisions of the Act.Violations where mala fide intent cannot be established, and those without serious implications, are being decriminalised through the landmark Jan Vishwas Bill. Like in any regulatory framework, the fear of rent-seeking and corruption must be addressed through extensive use of technology to make the framework discretion-free by minimising human intervention.The conventional system of metrology services requires significant time to follow established protocols, including paperwork. Stakeholders around the world are considering digital technologies, such as big data, the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain and cloud computing to provide metrology solutions that result in automated and paperless systems with transparent customer service.The creation of 'Virtual Instruments' and 'Digital Twins' is the result of advanced mathematical models of measurement tools. These technologies let organisations develop virtual representations of physical products, processes or services using real-time data, mock- ups, algorithms and AI. These technologies often cost less than physical prototypes, allowing an infinite number of variations.In line with GoI's aggressive push for Digital India, DCA is currently developing a blockchain-based solution to ensure a tamper-proof system of traceability and validation of issued certificates. Most of the interface with industry is being digitalised through the National Single Window System (NSWS). Adequate human capacities in digital metrology are being developed at the Indian Institute of Legal Metrology (IILM) in Ranchi, in partnership with IIT BHU, Varanasi.With its digital prowess, India has the potential to become the global supplier to meet the unprecedented demand for digital metrology and remote calibrations. With that, India can promise both assurance of quality as well as quantity, not only to the millions of domestic consumers but also to the rapidly expanding export market. Let's do it.The writer is secretary, department of consumer affairs, GoI",

The city government's Services department had sought the opinion of the Law department after the top court's verdict last week.  The judgment of the Constitution Bench has come into force with immediate effect. Any officer not giving effect to the judgment of the Constitution Bench shall be held liable for contempt,  said a note signed by Law Minister Kailash Gahlot. Gahlot also said the opinion of the Law department's principal secretary was read by him and it  appeared to be more of a practical advice rather than a strict legal opinion. His opinion also suffers from inherent contradictions . The Services department had also sought the opinion of the Delhi government's standing counsel (civil) on the implementation of the verdict. The Supreme Court said the Delhi government has legislative powers over Services matters and the Lt Governor is bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers, the note stated. The judgment has retrospective effect, it added.  ...not complying with any direction of the Government of Delhi for the reason of awaiting judgment of a regular three (judge) bench is nothing but defiance of the order passed by the Constitution Bench and is an attempt to undermine the authority of not only the Government of Delhi but also the Constitution Bench, which is highly undesirable and contemptuous in nature,  the note added. The top court's verdict is immediately applicable and the council of ministers must start discharging its responsibilities with respect to Services with immediate effect, the note stated.  The decision of the Regular Bench will have to be in conformity with the decision of the Constitution Bench. The regular bench is bound by the decision of the Constitution Bench,  it said. After the Supreme Court verdict, the Lt Governor cannot exercise executive control over Services anymore, the note further said. If the council of ministers waits for the Regular Bench decision to discharge its responsibilities with respect to the Services matter, transfer and postings will not be executed and there will be a  vacuum  in governance, it pointed out. A five-judge Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, in a unanimous verdict, put an end to the eight-year-old dispute between the Centre and the Delhi government triggered by a 2015 Ministry of Home Affairs notification asserting its control over Services, holding the National Capital Territory administration is unlike other Union Territories and has been  accorded a 'sui generis' (unique) status by the Constitution .",

        "description": "The Supreme Court on Friday directed the Centre and the state governments to undertake a time bound exercise to verify whether sexual harassment committees have been constituted in all ministries and the departments. The top court said there are serious lapses in the enforcement of the 2013 Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) Act.",
        "datePublished": "2023-05-12T16:42:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "Expressing concern over lack of committees in government departments to probe sexual harassment allegations at workplace, the Supreme Court on Friday said the issue needs urgent amelioration through robust and efficient implementation of the Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) Act. The top court said it is disquieting to note that there are serious lapses in the enforcement of the Act even after such a long time and termed it as a  sorry state of affairs  which reflects poorly on all the state functionaries, public authorities and private undertakings.A bench of justices A S Bopanna and Hima Kohli said the working of the Act is centred on the constitution of internal complaints committees (ICCs) by every employer at the workplace and constitution of local committees (LCs) and internal committees(ICs) by the appropriate government.The apex court said an improperly constituted ICC/LC/IC, would be an impediment in conducting an inquiry into a complaint of sexual harassment at the workplace, as envisaged under the statute and the rules. It will be equally counterproductive to have an ill prepared committee conduct a half-baked inquiry that can lead to serious consequences, namely, imposition of major penalties on the delinquent employee, to the point of termination of service. It is disquieting to note that there are serious lapses in the enforcement of the Act even after such a long passage of time,  the bench said.The top court also noted that this  glaring lacuna  has been recently brought to the fore by a national daily newspaper that has conducted and published a survey of 30 national sports federations in the country and reported that 16 out of them have not constituted an ICC till date. Where the ICC have been found to be in place, they do not have the stipulated number of members or lack the mandatory external member. This is indeed a sorry state of affairs and reflects poorly on all the State functionaries, public authorities, private undertakings, organizations and institutions that are duty bound to implement the PoSH Act in letter and spirit,  it said.The apex court said being a victim of such a deplorable act not only dents the self esteem of a woman, it also takes a toll on her emotional, mental and physical health. It is often seen that when women face sexual harassment at the workplace, they are reluctant to report such misconduct. Many of them even drop out from their job. One of the reasons for this reluctance to report is that there is an uncertainty about who to approach under the Act for redressal of their grievance. Another is the lack of confidence in the process and its outcome. This social malady needs urgent amelioration through robust and efficient implementation of the Act. To achieve this, it is imperative to educate the complainant victim about the import and working of the Act,  the bench said.The top court said the victims must be made aware of how a complaint can be registered, the procedure that would be adopted to process the complaint, the objective manner in which the ICC/LC/IC is expected to function under the statute. However salutary this enactment may be, it will never succeed in providing dignity and respect that women deserve at the workplace unless and until there is strict adherence to the enforcement regime and a proactive approach by all the State and non-State actors. If the working environment continues to remain hostile, insensitive and unresponsive to the needs of women employees, then the Act will remain an empty formality,  the bench said.The top court said if the  authorities/managements/employers  cannot assure them a safe and secure work place, they will fear stepping out of their homes to make a dignified living and exploit their talent and skills to the hilt. It is, therefore, time for the Union government and the state governments to take affirmative action and make sure that the altruistic object behind enacting the PoSH Act is achieved in real terms,  the bench said.The top court's observation came while hearing a plea filed by Aureliano Fernandes, former head of department of Goa University, challenging an order of Bombay high court regarding allegations of sexual harassment against him.The high court had dismissed his plea against an order of the Executive Council of Goa University (Disciplinary Authority) which dismissed him from services and disqualification from the future employment.The top court set aside the high court order noting procedural lapses in the inquiry proceedings and violation of principles of natural justice.",

The chief minister also expressed his  heartfelt thanks  to the Supreme Court for  doing justice to the people of Delhi . Following the top court verdict, Kejriwal has called a meeting with his cabinet ministers. In a unanimous verdict, the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the Delhi government has legislative and executive powers over services. Welcoming the verdict, the AAP said in a tweet in Hindi,  The elected government will have the power of transfer-posting of officers. Officers will work only through the elected government.  The Lt Governor will have no power over the officers to stop the work of the people of Delhi, the party said. Gopal Rai, the state convener of the AAP's Delhi unit, said at a press conference,  This is a tight slap on the Modi government and its mission to topple elected governments through unconstitutional methods. The Modi government had done the work of usurping the powers of the Delhi government through the Lt Governor and the Ministry of Home Affairs.  The Modi government was pushing democracy into darkness by destabilising governments.  They were running a  campaign to paralyse the work being done by the Delhi government , and the verdict is a  ray of hope in darkness , he added. Services Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj said Delhi's people have won the battle that was being fought by Kejriwal for nearly nine years.  Today, this battle has established one thing in the country -- there is one institution that will stand up and restore order whenever there will be a threat. That institution is the apex court.  Today, the Supreme Court has delivered a historic verdict. I feel that in today's time this verdict will be remembered in a long time,  he added. Calling Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud a national hero, the minister said the people of Delhi are indebted to him.  When we were small, we would watch Amitabh Bachchan playing a police inspector in a film and dream that we will become a policeman when we grow up. Similarly, if children would see doctor or a lawyer in a film, they would want to become that. For every kid who understands even a little bit about the state of affairs in the country and judiciary, there is one hero -- Chief Justice Chandrachud. Now they will say that they want to become a judge when they grow up. The country has got a hero in him,  he said.He also thanked the five-judge constitution bench on behalf of the people of Delhi.  We bow down before them. They have got back their right and it is a tight slap on the Centre,  he said. Delhi Minister Atishi said the verdict has  safeguarded the country's constitution and democracy .  The prime minister cannot tolerate that some other party wins. Wherever the BJP loses, unconstitutionally they carry out 'Operation Lotus' and poach MLAs there. When they could not topple the AAP government through these ways, they attempted to take away its powers,  she noted. She added that the Supreme Court has given a clear verdict that the government chosen by the people has powers to take decisions for them.  When people have chosen Kejriwal, then he will take a decision on behalf of the people of Delhi. Thanks to the Supreme Court, they have not just given a decision but also safeguarded the country's democracy and Constitution,  she said. Explaining what the verdict means, Bharadwaj said all types of officers were reporting to the Centre via the Lt Governor earlier.  If an officer was inefficient, there was no way of shifting him to some other department or controlling them. But now, this verdict has made it clear that executive powers and legislative powers lie with the government. It has been reiterated that the Lt Governor is bound by the aid and advice of the government in areas apart from police, public order and land,  he said. Asked whether the government can now refuse to share papers related to the chief minister's residence with the Lt Governor, he said,  I think it should not be looked at in terms of the chief minister's residence or the Lt Governor's residence. It is a matter of principles and we will act as per principles.  Atishi added that the Lt Governor can only see papers but he does not have any right to take decisions on them. AAP Rajya Sabha Raghav Chadha called the verdict a  landmark decision  and said it sends a stern message.  Satyamev Jayate. Delhi wins. Hon'ble Supreme Court's landmark judgment sends a stern message that officers working with the government of Delhi are meant to serve (the) people of Delhi through the elected government and not unelected usurpers parachuted by Centre to stall governance, namely LG,  Chadha tweeted. Atishi called the verdict  historic  and said earlier in a tweet in Hindi,  After a long battle, the Supreme Court got the Arvind Kejriwal government its right. Now, no one will be able to obstruct the work of the people of Delhi.  This historic decision is a win for the people of Delhi. Now Delhi will progress at double the speed. Congratulations everyone!  Hearing the Centre versus the Delhi government case over the demarcation of power, a constitution bench headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud said an elected government needs to have control over the administration. It refused to agree with Justice Ashok Bhushan's 2019 judgment that the city government has no power over the issue of services. The constitution bench was set up to hear the legal issue concerning the scope of legislative and executive powers of the Centre and the National Capital Territory government over control of services in Delhi.",

For the past two years, bilateral conferences were being held in virtual mode due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, they said. The discussions between India and Israel may include cooperation in modernization of police forces and border management, officials aware of the matter said. India shares borders with China, Pakistan, Bangladesh,Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal and Afghanistan and a large number of these borders are unfenced, for which New Delhi will be exploring technological solutions. India and Israel signed three important agreements on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, Cooperation in Homeland Security, and Protection of Classified Material in February 2014. The last physical meeting of the JSC took place in January 2020 in Israel. The first meeting of the JSC was held in Israel in September 2014.According to officials, four working groups in the areas of border management, internal security and public safety, police modernization and capacity building for combating crime, crime prevention and cyber crime were established by the committee. After this, there were working group meetings in India and Israel in March and July-August, 2015 respectively.From 2015, IPS officer trainees have been visiting the Israel National Police Academy every year for a one-week long foreign exposure training at the end of their training. On India-US homeland security, officials said that the last meeting took place in January 2022 in virtual mode and was chaired by union home secretary Ajay Bhalla and under secretary for Strategy, Policy and Plans, Department of Homeland Security, Government of USA, Robert Silvers.During the 2022 meeting, both sides have agreed to hold ministerial level homeland security dialogue towards the end of 2022 but dates could not be finalised. In 2018, India and US started 2+2 security dialogue where foreign and defence ministers of India and US meet on key strategic and security issues. The last meeting of 2+2 security pact was held in Washington and was attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh and foreign affairs minister Dr S Jaishankar.",

        "description": "The Indian government has urged state governments to submit their views on same-sex marriage in the country within ten days. The move came during the second day of a court hearing regarding marriage equality in India. Although the Supreme Court previously decreed that the historic 158-year-old ban on gay sex was  indefensible , the government contends that marriage is an \u201cexclusively heterogeneous institution\u201d and, if disrupted, would cause \u201ccomplete havoc\u201d within Indias deeply religious society. Same-sex couples require \u201ca language\u201d to assert their relationships as being equal to their straight counterparts, according to Menaka Guruswamy, a senior lawyer representing petitioners in the current case.",

        "articleBody": "On the second day of India's apex court hearing the case regarding the legality of same-sex marriage in the country, the Centre filed a fresh application, urging the Constitution Bench to take into account the views of state governments since  marriage  is in concurrent list.The Constitution Bench, headed by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, comprises justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, S Ravindra Bhat, PS Narasimha and Hima Kohli.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, requested the Constitution bench that states be made parties to the proceedings.On April 18, the government's Department of Legal Affairs wrote to all Chief Secretaries of states to submit their views on same sex marriage, urging them to submit their views in 10 days so that they can present the case before the Supreme Court. It is, therefore, humbly requested that all states and Union Territories be made a party to the present proceedings and their respective stance be taken on record and in the alternative, allow the Union of India, to finish the consultative process with the states, obtains their views/apprehensions, compile the same and place it on record before this court, and only thereafter adjudicate on the present issue,  the affidavit said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s administration has contended that granting legal recognition to relationships is \u201cessentially a function of the legislature,\u201d not of the judiciary. It has also argued that marriage is an \u201cexclusively heterogeneous institution\u201d and any interference to it \u201cwould cause complete havoc\u201d in India\u2019s deeply religious society. Some people in favor of marriage equality have rejected the notion that societal norms in India do not evolve.\u201cThe problem is this notion of fragility, which is just entirely self-created,\u201d said Menaka Guruswamy, a senior lawyer representing multiple petitioners in the case, including two lesbian couples and a trans woman. \u201cHindu society has enabled reform since independence,\u201d she said, citing the changes to a series of laws in the 1950s that allowed Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists to marry across religions and castes. Other laws allowed for divorce, the chance to adopt and equal rights for women to inherit property.Now, Guruswamy said, same-sex couples require \u201ca language\u201d to present their relationships as equally authentic as those by their straight counterparts, in a society where young people grow up watching Bollywood films about \u201cmismatched lovers\u201d and \u201cparental opposition.\u201d Those stories, she said, should make it easier, not harder, for Indians to accept love in all its forms.Almost five years ago, the Supreme Court ushered in a new era for LGBTQ rights in India. The ban on gay sex, a vestige of the country\u2019s colonial past, was \u201cindefensible,\u201d the court said in its unanimous order. In that groundbreaking case, the court ruled that \u201csexual autonomy of an individual\u201d was at the core of \u201cindividual liberty,\u201d and thus had no place in the country\u2019s legal system. Those actions fueled hopes that the court would act as a socially liberal counterweight to the conservative ethos of Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and its ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. But many members of India\u2019s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community say they continue to lead marginalized lives.The apex court had on November 25 last year sought the Centre's response to separate pleas moved by two gay couples seeking enforcement of their right to marry and a direction to the authorities concerned to register their marriages under the Special Marriage Act.",

        "articleBody": "Donald Trump has made history so many times.The first president without government or military experience. The first to be impeached twice. The first to aggressively challenge the certification of his successor.Now, he adds another: Even as he hopes to return to the White House in 2025, he is the first former president to be indicted.The latest line crossed by Trump challenges again the aura of the American presidency, nurtured in the infallibility of George Washington but made human over and over, through scandals born of greed and the abuse of power, corruption and naivete, sex and lies about sex.Trump is hardly the first president, in or out of office, to face legal trouble.In 1974, Richard Nixon may well have avoided criminal charges on obstruction of justice or bribery, related to the Watergate scandal, only because President Gerald Ford pardoned him just weeks after Nixon resigned the presidency. Bill Clinton's law license in his native Arkansas was suspended for five years after he reached a deal with prosecutors in 2001, at the end of his second term, over allegations that he lied under oath about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.Some historians wonder about President Warren Harding's fate had he not died in office, in 1923. Numerous officials around him would be implicated in various crimes, including Interior Secretary Albert B. Fall, whose corrupt land dealings became known as the  Teapot Dome Scandal.  The walls were closing in on him,  presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said of Harding.Trump's indictment in New York reportedly is linked to how business records were mischaracterized in connection with paying porn actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 in 2016, shortly before Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton for the presidency, to keep Daniels from going public about a sexual encounter she said she had with him years earlier. Trump denies having sex with her.Trump also is being investigated for allegedly attempting to change the 2020 vote results in Georgia, a state he narrowly lost to Democrat Joe Biden, and for his role in the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters attempted to stop the congressional certification of Biden as president. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and called the New York investigation  a witch hunt. While in office, Trump adopted the view of a Justice Department legal opinion that a president could not be indicted. Once a president leaves office, though, that protection falls away.Most ex-presidents of the past half-century have led relatively uneventful public lives - creating foundations, delivering lucrative speeches, or in the case of Jimmy Carter, doing abundant charitable works. Nixon's disgrace scarred him for years, though he eventually reemerged to talk about global affairs and counsel aspiring politicians and potential presidents, including Trump.The immediate cause of Nixon's resignation was the discovery of the  smoking gun  - Oval Office tape recordings, initiated by Nixon himself, that revealed he had ordered a cover-up of the 1972 break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington. By 1974, the scandal had expanded well beyond the initial crime. Many of Nixon's top aides had stepped down and were eventually imprisoned. Nixon himself was a possible target of the Watergate special counsel. There were partisans in Congress and on the special counsel's staff who would have liked to see Nixon indicted after the resignation - or at least believed that the pardon was premature,  says John A. Farrell, author of  Richard Nixon: The Life,  a prize-winning biography published in 2017.  But the special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, had consistently chosen to deal with Nixon via the constitutional, impeachment process. Farrell notes that Ford's pardon happened so soon after Nixon stepped down that Jaworski's office didn't have time to fully consider charges against Nixon. Ford himself would say that an  indictment, a trial, a conviction, and anything else that transpired  would have distracted the country from more immediate problems. This much can be said: Nixon himself was very worried about the possibility (of prosecution), to the point of ruining his health,  Farrell said, referring to Nixon's battles with phlebitis, the inflammation of veins in the leg.  He mused aloud about how some of the great political writing in history had been crafted in jail cells. His very worried family reached out to the White House, alerting Ford's aides of the ex-president's deteriorating condition. The administrations of Nixon and Harding were among several defined by scandal, without the president being charged.Ulysses Grant, the Union general and hero of the Civil War, was otherwise naive about those around him. Numerous members of his presidential administration were involved in financial wrongdoing, from extortion to market manipulation. Grant himself was caught for a more trivial offense. In 1872, during his first term, he was stopped twice for riding his carriage too fast. The second time Grant had to pay a $20 fine, but never spent a night in jail,  says historian Ron Chernow, whose Grant biography was published in 2017.Tragedy may have spared one future president.In the fall of 1963, Vice President Lyndon Johnson was out of favor in the Kennedy administration and in possible legal danger because his top aide, Bobby Baker, was under investigation for financial dealings and influence peddling. Johnson, with his own history of questionable finances, was denying any close ties to a man he had once claimed to love as a son.By the morning of Nov. 22, 1963, Life magazine was planning a investigation and congressional hearings were just getting started. But within hours, Kennedy had been assassinated, Johnson sworn in as his successor and interest in the affairs of Baker had essentially ended.",

        "articleBody": "The Maharashtra government told the Bombay High Court on Friday the 2018 tender for the Dharavi redevelopment project was cancelled and a fresh tender was issued in 2022 because of several factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia war that affected financial and economic affairs. The Gautam Adani Group had bagged the 2022 tender with a bid of Rs 5,069 crore to redevelop an area of 259 hectares. The government's decision to cancel the 2018 tender and issue a fresh tender in 2022 with additional conditions was challenged in the HC by UAE-based company Seclink Technologies Corporation, which had emerged as the highest bidder in the earlier tender with a Rs 7200 crore bid. The state Housing Department, in its affidavit filed in reply to the petition, said a decision was taken to cancel the earlier tender and issue a fresh one with new conditions due to several factors, adding the financial and economic state of affairs in 2019 and in 2022 were materially different.  The present economic state of affairs is materially affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia-Ukraine war, uncertainty over Rupee-USD rate, interest rate volatility and overall high-risk perception of common investor,  the affidavit said. Hence, the government took a bonafide decision after obtaining legal advice to cancel the tender and float a new tender in public interest. The first tender for the redevelopment project was issued in November 2018, and bids were opened in March 2019. In the same month, an additional 45 acres was made available to the government by the Railways for the redevelopment project, the affidavit said. The Housing Department's affidavit claimed there was no formation of contract between the government and the petitioner company and, hence, it (company) has no legal right.  The petitioner has no vested right to get an award in a tender process. Any person who submits a bid can only legitimately expect his bid is considered in a non-arbitrary and transparent manner. No person has a right to do business with the government as a matter of right,  it said. The affidavit said the first tender dated 28 November, 2018 was cancelled by a government resolution (GR) dated November 5, 2020 as there was material change in the tender condition after the  bid due date . The affidavit also termed the petitioner's allegations of the government having acted arbitrarily to favour the selected bidder (Adani) as  vague and ambiguous , adding the old tender and the new one were different and could not be compared. In the new tender, the bids were to be submitted afresh and the petitioner could have taken part as there was no question of excluding anyone's participation, it said. Senior counsel Abhinav Chandrachud and advocates Suresh Iyer and Jenil Shah, appearing for the petitioner company, argued it had bid Rs 7200 crore, while the highest bid in the second tender (Adani) was Rs 5,069 crore. A division bench of Acting Chief Justice S V Gangapurwala and Justice Sandeep Marne on Friday said it would hear the plea on March 14.",

        "description": "Later Friday, the Pentagon acknowledged reports of a second balloon flying over Latin America.  We now assess it is another Chinese surveillance balloon,  Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement, declining to offer further information such as where it was spotted.",

        "articleBody": "A huge, high-altitude Chinese balloon sailed across the U.S. on Friday, drawing severe Pentagon accusations of spying on sensitive military sites despite China's firm denials. Secretary of State Antony Blinken abruptly canceled a high-stakes Beijing trip aimed at easing U.S.-China tensions. Aside from the government response, fuzzy videos dotted social media as people with binoculars and telephoto lenses tried to find the  spy balloon  in the sky as it headed southeastward over Kansas and Missouri at 60,000 feet (18,300 meters). It was spotted earlier over Montana, which is home to one of America's three nuclear missile silo fields at Malmstrom Air Force Base, defense officials said. Later Friday, the Pentagon acknowledged reports of a second balloon flying over Latin America.  We now assess it is another Chinese surveillance balloon,  Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement, declining to offer further information such as where it was spotted. The U.S. actually had been tracking the initial balloon since at least Tuesday, when President Joe Biden was first briefed, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. According to three U.S. officials, Biden was initially inclined to order the surveillance balloon to be blown out of the sky, and a senior defense official said the U.S. had prepared fighter jets, including F-22s, to shoot it down if ordered.  The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, strongly advised Biden against shooting down the balloon, warning that its size - as big as three school buses - and considerable weight could create a debris field large enough to endanger Americans on the ground. The Pentagon also assessed that after unspecified U.S. measures, the possibility of the balloon uncovering important information was not great. It was not the first time Chinese surveillance balloons have been tracked over U.S. territory, including at least once during former President Donald Trump's administration, officials said. Blinken's trip cancellation came despite China's claim that the balloon was merely a weather research  airship  that had blown off course. The Pentagon rejected that out of hand - as well as China's contention that the balloon was not being used for surveillance and had only limited navigational ability. Blinken, who had been due to depart Washington for Beijing late Friday, said he had told senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi in a phone call that sending the balloon over the U.S. was  an irresponsible act and that (China's) decision to take this action on the eve of my visit is detrimental to the substantive discussions that we were prepared to have.  China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement Saturday morning:  In actuality, the U.S. and China have never announced any visit. The U.S. making any such announcement is their own business, and we respect that.  According to Beijing, Wang said China  has always strictly followed international law, we do not accept any groundless speculation and hype. Faced with unexpected situations, both parties need to keep calm, communicate in a timely manner, avoid misjudgments and manage differences.  After passing the sensitive military sites in Montana, the balloon was moving southeastward over the heartland of the central United States during the day and was expected to remain in U.S. airspace for several days, officials said. The development dealt a new blow to already strained U.S.-Chinese relations that have been in a downward spiral for years over numerous issues. Still, U.S. officials maintained that diplomatic channels remain open and Blinken said he remained willing to travel to China  when conditions allow.   We continue to believe that having open lines of communication is important,  he said. Biden declined to comment on the matter when questioned at an economic event. Two likely 2024 reelection challengers, Trump, and Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador, said the U.S. should immediately shoot down the balloon. Several Republican congressmen said the same, and a number blasted the administration for  allowing  the balloon intrusion.  The idea that Communist China has a spy balloon headed towards Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri right now - the home of the Stealth Bomber - is absolutely unbelievable,  said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo.  No American should accept this. I don't.  Jean-Pierre did not shed light on why the administration waited until Thursday to make its concerns public. Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, refused to say Friday whether there was any new consideration of shooting the balloon down. He said it currently was posing no threat. Ryder said it was maneuverable, not just at the mercy of the wind, and had changed course. Still, weather experts said China's claim that the balloon had gone off course was not unfeasible. China's account of wind patterns known as the Westerlies carrying a balloon to the western United States was  absolutely possible - not possible, likely,  said Dan Jaffe, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of Washington. As for Blinken's trip, Jean-Pierre said a diplomatic visit to China was not appropriate at such a time. She said that  the presence of this balloon in our airspace ... is a clear violation of our sovereignty as well as international law and it is unacceptable this occurred.  A State Department official said Blinken and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman had both protested to the top official at the Chinese Embassy on Wednesday, a day before the Pentagon announced the discovery of the balloon. Blinken's long-anticipated meetings with senior Chinese officials had been seen in both countries as a possible way to find some areas of common ground at a time of major disagreements over Taiwan, human rights, China's claims in the South China Sea, North Korea, Russia's war in Ukraine, trade policy and climate change. Although the trip, which was agreed to in November by Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit in Indonesia, had not been formally announced, officials in both Beijing and Washington had spoken in recent days about Blinken's imminent arrival for meetings on Sunday and Monday. China, which angrily denounces surveillance attempts by the U.S. and others over areas it considers to be its territory and once forced down an American spy plane and held its crew captive on Hainan Island, was relatively conciliatory in its response to the U.S. complaints. In a statement that approached an apology, the Chinese foreign ministry said the balloon was a civilian airship used mainly for meteorological research. It said said the airship had limited  self-steering  capabilities and had  deviated far from its planned course  because of winds.   The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into U.S. airspace due to force majeure,  the statement said, citing a legal term used to refer to events beyond one's control.",

The regulations are part of continuing efforts to curb misleading advertisements as well protect the interests of consumers amid the expanding social influencer market which is projected to be worth around Rs 2,800 crore by 2025. The new guidelines named 'Endorsement Know Hows -- for celebrities, influencers and virtual media influencers (Avatar or computer generated character) on social media platforms' has been issued by the Department of Consumers Affairs. In case of violation, the penalty prescribed for misleading advertisement under the Consumer Protection Act 2019 will be applicable. The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) can impose penalty of up to Rs 10 lakh on manufacturers, advertisers and endorsers. For subsequent offences, penalty of up to Rs 50 lakh can be imposed. The authority can prohibit endorser of a misleading ad from making any endorsement for up to 1 year and for subsequent contravention, prohibition can extend up to 3 years. Launching these guidelines at a press conference, Consumer Affairs Secretary Rohit Kumar Singh said the guidelines have been issued under the ambit of the consumer law that provides framework for the protection of consumers against unfair trade practices and misleading advertisements. He hoped that the guidelines would act as a deterrent for social media influencers.  It's a very important subject. The size of social influencer market in India in 2022 was of the order of Rs 1,275 crore and by 2025, it is likely to rise to Rs 2,800 crore with a compound annual growth rate of about 19-20 per cent. The social media influencer of substance, those having good number of followers, are in excess of 1 lakh in the country,  Singh said. Stating that the social media influencing is here to stay and will only grow exponentially, he said social influencers need to behave responsibly.  The today's guidelines are aimed at social media influencers which have material connection with the brand they want to promote on various social media platforms. This is an obligation for them to behave responsibly as far as the disclosure is concerned to the consumers.  One of the biggest paradigm of the consumer law is the consumers right to know and this falls in that purview. Consumers should know if something is thrown at him from digital media, the person or the entity which is sponsoring it have they taken money or any form of connection they have with the brand,  Singh said. The secretary said if non-compliance takes place, there are provisions under the law for people to approach the authority to seek legal action against people who are defaulting.  These guidelines broadly define that framework as to how social media influencers should indulge in disclosure of their relationship with the brand,  the secretary said. CCPA Chief Commissioner Nidhi Khare noted that misleading Advertisements in any form, format or medium is prohibited by law. The new guidelines have specified who all need to disclose, when to disclose and how to disclose. Individuals/groups who have access to an audience and the power to affect their audiences' purchasing decisions or opinions about a product, service, brand or experience, because of the influencer's/celebrity's authority, knowledge, position, or relationship with their audience will have to disclose the material connection, as per the new norm. The disclosure should happen  when there is a material connection between an advertiser and celebrity/influencer that may affect the weight or credibility of the representation made by the celebrity/influencer , Khare said. She said the disclosure should be in such a manner that it is  hard to miss  and should be in simple language. The disclosures should be placed in the endorsement message in such a manner that they are clear, prominent and extremely hard to miss. Disclosures should not be mixed with a group of hashtags or links. In endorsement in a picture, disclosures should be superimposed over the image enough for viewers to notice. In video, disclosures should be placed in the video and not just in the description and they should be made in both audio and video format. In the case of live stream, disclosures should be displayed continuously and prominently during the entire stream. On limited space platforms like Twitter, terms such as 'XYZ Ambassador' (where XYZ is a brand) are also acceptable, she said. The secretary said that these guidelines are being issued under the overall ambit of Consumer Protection Act and one of the main underlining principle of the law is prevention of unfair trade practice.  There are many ways in which unfair trading practices take place, one of the important unfair trading practice is the menace of misleading advertisements, by trying to sell something which is not exactly as it is being portrayed in the ad.  While it has been ably handled in the conventional media -- which is TV, print and radio, the social and digital media platforms are turning out to be different ball game,  Singh said.",

Rules must be made in a way that the compliance burden is as less as possible on smaller players and newer entrants,\u201d noted a senior official. \u201cThere are only some aspects \u2014 such as the legality of content, service and excessive violence in games \u2014 which will be carefully monitored.\u201dThe Centre is also likely to suggest that states not ban online games outright but, instead, \u201cpenalise them\u201d only in cases of serious lapses.\u201cWe are looking to drop criminal and strict penal provisions so the industry is able to innovate and move ahead without any fear. Of course, proper guardrails will always be there,\u201d according to officials cited above, who said, \u201cThese will initially be our suggestion to the states.\u201dThe upcoming rules are likely to be similar to the Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code that was introduced in 2021 and reworked earlier this year.Maintaining ScrutinyGaming companies will also be asked to enforce strict know-your-customer norms \u2014 establishing the correct age of players\u2019 by verifying it with a government-issued identity card. Gaming intermediaries will also be required to conduct additional scrutiny of methods used to purchase in-game add-ons.For instance, if a credit or debit card is repeatedly used to purchase in-game additions or buy additional playing time, gaming companies can analyse these patterns to establish the probable age of the buyer, or if the card is being misused by a minor.\u201cThose aspects can be looked into. Of course, we will need to have more than adequate consultation on these issues,\u201d officials said.In August, ET reported that an inter-ministerial group tasked with drawing up a framework to regulate online gaming had suggested introducing daily and caps on the amount of money individual players spend in a game.However, gaming companies are contending that the \u201clevel of expenditure\u201d could vary from person to person. They also have inbuilt systems that follow the pattern of gaming and ask players\u2019 beforehand about the maximum amount they would want to spend per day or per session.\u201cBut there are no checks and balances in place to ascertain the maximum amount that can be spent. That will have to be looked at as well,\u201d a second official said.The seven-member inter-ministerial task force, which was set up in May, includes members from the Niti Aayog, secretaries from the ministry of home affairs, Department of Revenue, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, ministry of information and broadcasting as well as the MeitY secretary.",

        "articleBody": "China fails to realise that India actually manages Arunachal Pradesh legally while it merely claims it. As the Chinese way of saying it-  Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India , writes Amrita Jash, Assistant Professor at the Department of Geopolitics and International Relations at the Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) in Manipal in her report for Border Lens.The report also states that:  China rejects the McMahon Line, the boundary between China and India, which it calls  illegal  and  unacceptable , for the following reasons: first, the Sino-Indian boundary has never been properly demarcated; no treaty or agreement has been made between the Chinese Central Government and the government of India. Secondly, Beijing believes the McMahon Line to be an imperialist legacy.What is interesting to note though is that in 1960, Beijing accepted the McMahon Line, which China adamantly condemns in the case of Arunachal Pradesh, in order to settle the border dispute with Myanmar. Initially, China only laid claim to the Tawang region of Arunachal Pradesh. Since the 1980s, however, Beijing has started claiming all of Arunachal Pradesh as part of its 'South Tibet' territory. Chinese transgressions along the LAC and episodes of stand-offs are a common behavioural pattern demonstrated by China in asserting its sovereignty claims over Arunachal Pradesh,  writes Amrita Jash for Border Lens.Official Chinese maps have renamed some locations in Arunachal Pradesh. The Chinese Ministry of Aviation in December 2021, standardised the names of 15 locations in Arunachal Pradesh.China has also condemned the visit of Indian leaders and the Dalai Lama to Arunachal Pradesh. As in recent times, Beijing's objection was noted against Vice President M. Venkaiah Naidu's visit to Arunachal Pradesh in October 2021. China's opposition stands invalid given Arunachal Pradesh is a state of India, as the Ministry of External Affairs rightly posited:  Objecting to the visit of Indian leaders to a state of India does not stand to reason and understanding of the Indian people ,  writes Jash.Beijing also claims to have built 'Xiaokang' village models along the Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh, the author reported.Recently, it was reported that despite the recent Tawang face-off between the Indian and Chinese soldiers in the Yangtse area, the local villagers of Zemithang are not worried about such type of incident and they have full confidence in the Union government and the Indian Army and are certain that they will protect them.Zemithang with a population of about 5,000 is the last village in India. It is located in Arunachal Pradesh's Tawang district and is just 10 km away from the LAC.Zemithang is the last border village of Arunachal Pradesh along the Indo-China border.",

        "description": "Musk appears to be gearing up for legal battles at Twitter, which he purchased in October for $44 billion, according to seven people familiar with internal conversations.",
        "datePublished": "2022-12-14T16:14:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "Over the past two weeks, Elon Musk has shaken up Twitter's legal department, disbanded a council that advised the social media company on safety issues and is continuing to take drastic steps to cut costs. Musk appears to be gearing up for legal battles at Twitter, which he purchased in October for $44 billion, according to seven people familiar with internal conversations. He and his team have revamped Twitter's legal department and pushed out one of his closest advisers in the process. They have also instructed employees to not pay vendors in anticipation of potential litigation, the people said. To cut costs, Twitter has not paid rent for its San Francisco headquarters or any of its global offices for weeks, three people close to the company said. Twitter has also refused to pay a $197,725 bill for private charter flights made the week of Musk's takeover, according to a copy of a lawsuit filed in New Hampshire District Court and obtained by The New York Times. Twitter's leaders have also discussed the consequences of denying severance payments to thousands of people who have been laid off since the takeover, two people familiar with the talks said. And Musk has threatened employees with lawsuits if they talk to the media and  act in a manner contrary to the company's interest,  according to an internal email sent last Friday. The aggressive moves signal that Musk is still slashing expenditures and is bending or breaking Twitter's previous agreements to make his mark. His reign has been characterized by chaos, a series of resignations and layoffs, reversals of the platform's previous suspensions and rules, and capricious decisions that have driven away advertisers. Musk did not respond to a request for comment. As he has transitioned into the role of Twitter's new leader, Musk has had a cast of rotating legal professionals by his side. In October, he fired both Twitter's chief legal officer and general counsel  for cause  within hours of closing his acquisition and installed his personal lawyer, Alex Spiro, to head up legal and policy matters at the company. Spiro is no longer working at Twitter, according to six people familiar with the decision. Those people said that Musk has been unhappy with some decisions made by Spiro, a noted criminal defense lawyer who successfully defended the billionaire in a high-profile defamation case in late 2019 and worked his way into the Twitter owner's inner circle. Among those decisions was Spiro's call to retain Twitter's deputy general counsel, James A. Baker, through Musk's various rounds of layoffs and firings. Baker had served as general counsel at the FBI until May 2018 - advising the agency on politically fraught investigations into Hillary Rodham Clinton's private email server and Donald Trump's campaign - and joined Twitter in 2020. Last week, Musk said he terminated Baker after he learned that the lawyer had been responsible for reviewing internal communications about the company's decision to suppress a 2020 New York Post story about Hunter Biden's laptop. Musk had ordered that those communications, which he has called the  Twitter Files,  be given to a group of journalists to release and discredit the decision-making of the company's past executives. With Twitter drained of legal talent from layoffs and departures, Musk has sought lawyers from his other companies, including rocket maker SpaceX, to fill the void. More than half a dozen lawyers from the space exploration company have been given access to Twitter's internal systems, according to two people and documents seen by the Times. SpaceX employees who have been brought in to Twitter include Chris Cardaci, the company's vice president of legal, and Tim Hughes, its senior vice president, global business and government affairs. A SpaceX spokesperson did not return a request for comment. Among its legal challenges, Twitter is facing more questions from the Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating whether the company is still adhering to a consent decree. In 2011, the company signed a consent decree with the FTC after two data breaches and said it would not mislead users about privacy protection. In May, the company paid $150 million to the FTC and Justice Department to settle allegations that it had violated the terms of that consent decree, which was expanded. The FTC has sent Twitter letters asking whether it still has the resources and staff to adhere to the consent decree, two people with knowledge of the matter said. An FTC spokesperson declined to comment. On Friday, as Musk encouraged the release of internal information through the continuation of his Twitter Files, he also sent an email to employees noting  many detailed leaks of confidential Twitter information  showed that some were violating their nondisclosure agreements.  If you clearly and deliberately violate the NDA that you signed when joining Twitter, you accept liability to the full extent of the law and Twitter will immediately seek damages,  he wrote. The email was first reported by the Platformer newsletter. Musk's team has also deliberated the merits of not paying severance to the thousands of people who have left the company since he took over, when there were about 7,500 full-time employees. While Musk and his advisers had previously considered forgoing any severance when discussing cuts in late October, the company ultimately decided that U.S.-based employees would be given at least two months of pay and one month of severance pay so that the company would be compliant with federal and state labor laws. Musk's team is now reconsidering whether it should pay some of those months, according to two people familiar with the discussions, or just face lawsuits from disgruntled former employees. Many former employees still have not received any paperwork formalizing their separation from Twitter, five people said. Musk has already refused to pay millions of dollars in exit packages to executives he claims were terminated  for cause. ",

A round-the-clock control room and 19 teams on the field have helped in the strict implementation of the protocol, bringing things under control, she said.  So far, we have six positive cases, and all the samples tested for the last three days were negative,  the minister said. The Central teams who have been working with the Kerala health department have expressed their appreciation for the work the department has done to effectively contain the outbreak. 103766141 They (the Central team members) sit in all discussions. Our team leaders will explain every day in the convergence meeting how a contact, which is very important, a very high-risk contact was identified. So the Central teams have really appreciated our work,  George said. Three Central teams, one from ICMR, one from NIV, Pune, and one from the Epidemiological Institute, Chennai are in Kerala. They had earlier visited the containment zones and Nipah epicentre in 2018 and have also conducted bat surveillance. The system responded very well as per the protocol and guidelines, which were twice modified in 2021 and then in 2023, in the treatment and containment of Nipah, the minister said.  Primarily, we are giving antiviral medicines like Remdesivir. The dosages for infants and adults are all well written. The protocol is being followed by both government and private hospitals,  George said. Understanding the vulnerability of Kozhikode to the disease outbreak, a strict protocol has been followed since 2018.  We have set up a testing lab at the Medical College, Kozhikode. In August this year, we tested 35 samples for the Nipah virus. This year, hundreds of samples were tested. If anyone has encephalitis, then that sample will be sent for testing for Nipah,  the minister said. The system has always been on high alert, and a diagnosis protocol was ready. Many studies have been conducted in Kozhikode from 2018 onwards including bat surveillance, she said.  We are on constant alert, constant vigil, that will continue, and integration of some departments, like we have developed a  one health programme  in Kerala based on our experiences on Nipah. Because this is an era of zoonotic diseases, we cannot stay away from the concept of  one health  and it is only the state of Kerala that has developed that concept,  George said.  One health  is a programme launched by the state health department where all the concerned departments will get a platform for convergence in fighting against infectious diseases outbreak. The minister said for better convergence of departments in case of any infectious disease outbreak, the government is planning to set up a One Health Institute in Kozhikode. Asked about restrictions for anyone visiting Kerala or Kozhikode, she said there is no travel ban.  See, we have a protocol; according to our guidelines, when a Nipah case is reported, the area within the five-kilometre radius is declared as a containment zone. There is movement restriction only in that particular area,  George said. She said not even the whole of Kozhikode district is affected, but only few wards. Terming contact tracing as very challenging, George said many people do not admit that they were in contact with the positive patient initially. So when health workers called up, they were reluctant to admit the places they visited.  For example, if a patient visits a hospital, it is easier for us to get the details of other patients and also the list of health workers. But some patients may have more than one bystander, and we may not know that,  George said. She said these people later admitted their presence after a counselling session. To handle such cases, the Kerala government sought the help of the police department to confirm the location through mobile tower analysis. The health minister said that in none of the previous outbreaks, the entire contact list could be traced. The total number of cases of Nipah infection confirmed in the state are six, of which two persons have died and four persons are being treated. The World Health Organisation and ICMR studies have found that the entire state, not just Kozhikode, is prone to such infections.",

The infected patients are improving, including a nine-year-old boy who has been taken off ventilation temporarily. The treatment using a monoclonal antibody is only 50-60% effective, but a more efficient version is being developed. ",

        "articleBody": "The Kerala government on Sunday said the Nipah outbreak in the state is under control as there were no new positive cases for the second consecutive day and that the already infected patients were getting better. State Health Minister Veena George said it was a big relief for the state that no new fresh positive cases of the virus have been detected.  The situation is under control presently,  she said. The minister was speaking to reporters here in the evening after a review of the Nipah situation in this north Kerala district of the state. George said the four infected persons, including a nine-year-old boy, were getting better and the child has been taken off ventilator for the time being. Regarding the treatment using a monoclonal antibody, the only experimental therapeutic available to the government against the virus, the minister said the present variant was only 50-60 per cent effective and that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has assured that it will get a new and more efficient version. She also said that samples from 36 bats have been taken and sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune to ascertain the presence of the virus among the mammals. George further said that since all the infected persons got the virus from the same person -- the index case -- who died on August 30, it was clear that there was no second wave and that it was welcome news.  It can also be proved through genomic sequencing which is being carried out,  she said. So far, 1,233 contacts have been traced and of them 352 are in the high-risk category, she said. Earlier in the day, the minister said that as no new positive Nipah cases were being reported, the containment and quarantine measures would remain in place for 42 days from the last positive case reported. The incubation period of the virus is 21 days and therefore,  a double incubation period of 42 days from the last positive case  is considered as the period during which caution has to be exercised, George explained In the morning, she also said that a central team was surveying the area of the 2018 Nipah outbreak and will look for any ecological changes there, while teams from NIV Pune and ICMR are also carrying out field surveys in the district. State Tourism Minister P A Mohamed Riyas, who was also part of the press briefing, said that people were cooperating very well with the government's containment and quarantine efforts. George, in a statement, also said that the state was well equipped to carry out Nipah testing and can also confirm the presence of the virus through the tests. The mobile labs of Rajiv Gandhi Center for Biotechnology and NIV Pune have also helped to expedite testing and strengthen preventive measures, she said. Giving details of the testing process, the minister said the procedure is complicated due to the dangerous nature of the virus. At the same time, persons infected with Nipah do not show symptoms in the initial stages, which is a challenge as early testing is critical to increase the chances of survival and prevent the spread of the disease. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) or PCR tests are used to detect the Nipah virus, she said. Meanwhile, the state government has launched a special out patient department (OPD) service in connection with Nipah under its e-Sanjeevini telemedicine system, Kozhikode District Collector A Geetha had said in a Facebook post. In her post, Geetha also advised people against frightening bats by throwing stones at them or making loud noises by bursting firecrackers, setting fire to their roots and cutting down trees they inhabit. The Collector said that when bats infected with Nipah are harmed, frightened or moved from their habitat, the level of the virus in their body increases due to stress. As a result, the viruses will be expelled through body fluids and this will increase the risk of spread of the infection, she said. The total number of cases of Nipah infection confirmed in the state are six, of which two persons have died and four persons are being treated. The World Health Organisation and ICMR studies have found that the entire state, not just Kozhikode, is prone to such infections.",

Launching the 'Ayushman Bhavah' campaign, Murmu said it is a comprehensive nationwide healthcare initiative that aims to provide saturation coverage of healthcare services in every village and town in the country.  I have been told that multi-ministerial approach is being taken to implement the programme. To achieve such a big target everyone's cooperation is critical,  the president said.  No person should be left behind and no village should be left behind i.e. 100 per cent people can avail health services. This goal will make our country successful in achieving the objective of Universal health coverage in true sense,  the President said. The prime minister has given central importance to Mahatma Gandhi's idea of 'Antyodaya' in his activities. This campaign to provide health services to the last person in the last village is inspired by the ideal of 'Antyodaya', the president said. The president noted that during the G20 meeting members nations put forth a clear road map for the G20 2023 action plan for accelerating progress on the sustainable development goals.  The government of India has set localised sustainable development goals in order to achieve the UN's SDG 2030. Under this, a major focus is on development works at the rural level,  she said. Village panchayats that successfully saturate the health schemes will earn the prestigious title of 'Ayushman Gram Panchayat' or 'Ayushman Urban Ward,' symbolising their dedication to equitable healthcare provision, she said. The campaign, which has been launched on Tuesday, will be implemented during the 'Seva Pakhwada' starting from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday on September 17 and continue till October 2, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said. The campaign is a collaborative effort spearheaded by gram panchayats in coordination with the Department of Health, other government departments, and local elected bodies in rural and urban areas.  Its core objective is to extend comprehensive healthcare coverage to every village and town, transcending geographical barriers and ensuring that no one is left behind,  the minister said. This synergistic approach aims to saturate coverage of health services through its three components -- Ayushman-Apke Dwar 3.0, Ayushman Melas at Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) and Community Health Centres (CHCs) and Ayushman Sabhas in every village and panchayat. Through the Ayushman Apke Dwar 3.0, initiative the government aims to provide Ayushman cards to remaining eligible beneficiaries enrolled under the PM-JAY scheme, ensuring that more individuals have access to essential health services. Ayushman Melas at HWCs and CHCs will facilitate the creation of ABHA IDs (Health IDs) and issuance of Ayushman Bharat Cards. They will also offer early diagnosis, comprehensive primary health care services, tele-consultation with specialists, and appropriate referrals, Mandaviya said. Under the Ayushman Sabhas, gatherings in every village and panchayat will play a pivotal role in distributing Ayushman cards, generating ABHA IDs, and raising awareness about vital health schemes and disease conditions, such as non-communicable diseases, tuberculosis. sickle cell disease, as well as blood donation and organ donation drives. The Ayushman Bhavah campaign is aligned with the vision of creating 'Healthy Villages' and 'Healthy Gram Panchayats,' laying the foundation for achieving Universal Health Coverage in the country.",

Kerala Health Minister Veena George chaired a high-level meeting to evaluate the situation in Kozhikode. She said the entire health machinery in the district is on alert. Kozhikode also reported deaths due to Nipah virus in 2018 and 2021. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Nipah virus infection is a zoonotic illness that is transmitted to people from animals. It can also be transmitted through contaminated food or from one person to another. It causes a range of illnesses, from asymptomatic (subclinical) infection to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis, among infected people.",

The chief minister urged people not to panic and to take precaution instead.  Everyone should strictly follow the instructions of the health department and the police and fully cooperate with the restrictions,  he said. Talking to reporters in Kozhikode after receiving confirmation from the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, where the samples were sent for testing, state Health Minister Veena George said one of the people who was infected with the virus is a nine-year-old boy. George said out of the five samples, three have tested positive.  The samples of the person who died yesterday and two others under treatment, including the nine-year-old boy, have tested positive,  she said. The death of the first person, on August 30, was initially considered a death due to the comorbidity of liver cirrhosis, she said.  However, his son, the nine-year-old boy who is already in ICU, and his 24-year-old brother-in-law are the two positive cases that were detected today,  the minister said. The sample of the person who died yesterday also tested positive. The minister added that two epicentres of the disease have been identified, which will soon be declared as containment zones by the district collector after following due procedure. The man who died on August 30 was 44 years old, while the person who died yesterday as a 40-year-old man. The health department has also found out that the deceased persons were together in a private hospital for almost one hour at a particular point of time and as of now, there are no other points of contact for them other than that.  As of now, it is understood that the index case is the man who died on August 30. Because his nine-year-old son and his brother-in-law have now tested positive,  she said. A massive contact tracing exercise has already begun, she added. The health department has identified 168 contacts among the two deceased persons found infected with the Nipah virus. The minister said that in the first case, 158 contacts were identified, out of which 127 were health workers and the rest were family or those from the locality of his residence. In the second case, nearly 200 contacts were traced, out of which 10 have been identified along with their mobile numbers. She said the control room and the call centre have started functioning, and asked people who experience any symptoms to contact the call centre, from where an ambulance for their transportation to the hospital will be arranged. Earlier in the day, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said that the two deaths reported from Kerala's Kozhikode district were caused by the Nipah virus.",

The Act also mandates the authority to have independent domain experts, patient representatives, care givers and NGO apart from ex-officio government members.",

        "articleBody": "Lt Governor VK Saxena has approved setting up State Mental Health Authority, pointing out a delay of around five years on the part of Delhi government in constituting the panel for it, officials at LG office said on Monday. No immediate reaction was available from Delhi government over the allegation of delay in constitution of the Authority.  The Central Mental Health Care Act, 2017 mandates setting up of State Mental Health Authority (SMHA) for the welfare of patients with mental illness. The Act also mandates the authority to have independent domain experts, patient representatives, care givers and NGO apart from ex-officio government members.   Delhi is yet to have its SMHA. The Delhi government, under pressure from the Centre, finally moved a proposal to constitute Delhi SMHA after a delay of 5 years, only with ex-officio members,  officials said.  The LG while giving approval to the proposal  slammed government apathy  in the matter and directed it to immediately initiate the process of appointing independent domain experts, representatives of patients and care givers, as well as NGOs to the authority, they said.  In his noting on the file for approval to SMHA, the LG pointed that the authority was to be set up within nine months of the enactment of Mental Health Care Act 2017 with nod by the President.  The Act stipulates that the SMHA will have one each of an independent and eminent psychiatrist, mental health professional, psychiatrist social worker, clinical psychologist, mental health nurse (all with 15 years' experience), as well as two representatives each of patients, care givers and NGOs, according to the LG's office.  Such wide representation in SMHA was obviously aimed at covering all aspects of mental health care so that it functions as a dynamic body and not just another bureaucratic regulator, he said in the file note.   In the light of the above, it is surprising that the proposal for constitution of SMHA, after a lapse of more than 5 years since the enactment of the Act in 2017, has been put up now and that too, comprising only of ex-officio members,  Saxena noted on the file.  This  cavalier approach  exhibited by the Health department in the constitution of such an important statutory authority is  deeply disconcerting,  the LG observed.  The proposal for SMHA was approved by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Health minister Saurabh Bhardwaj before seeking nod of the LG on it.   What is even more concerning is that it took the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, to request through its communication dated August 29, 2022, to take early actions in establishing SMHA, for the Delhi government to be shaken out of its inertia,  said the LG.  Even then Delhi government  did not care to expedite  such statutorily warranted action, and the proposal kept pending before the Health minister for almost four and half months, he said.   I am constrained to flag this lackadaisicalness and expect that the Chief Minister will ensure appropriate measures to address such concerns in the future,  he said in the file note.  Giving his approval to the proposal, the LG said that the Health department of Delhi government was required to refer it to the Ministry of Home Affairs for seeking approval of President of India on it, in accordance with the provisions under Section 45D of Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2023.  The SMHA is mandated to play a pivotal role in registration, supervision, and development of quality care and services along with norms for mental health establishments within the state.  The authority, as per the Act, is also responsible for registering clinical psychologists, mental health nurses, and psychiatric social workers, as mental health professionals in a state.",

        "articleBody": "Disease outbreaks can be a source of great distress for both patients and authorities alike. However, in a significant development, Bengaluru, the tech capital of India, is taking a proactive step towards predicting these outbreaks well in advance. As per a TOI report, in collaboration with ARTPARK of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the Health and Family Welfare Department are set to unveil a cutting-edge disease surveillance dashboard. This innovative system has the remarkable capability to forecast surges in infections up to four weeks ahead, boasting an impressive accuracy rate of up to 70 per cent.Developed by a team of scientists hailing from IISc, IIT-Madras, and the Indian Statistical Institute, this disease surveillance dashboard marks a significant milestone in post-pandemic disease prediction. Unlike previous mathematical models primarily designed for predicting Covid-19 waves, this dashboard can forecast various communicable diseases, including vector-borne illnesses such as dengue, chikungunya, and malaria. Although initially intended for Bengaluru, it has the potential to make predictions for the entire state.The dashboard team comprises 10-15 experts spanning various fields, including medicine, epidemiology, entomology, and computer science. During a recent review of the dengue situation in Bengaluru, these experts provided a demonstration of the dashboard to Health Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao. Praising this groundbreaking tool, Rao emphasized that it will enable the government and BBMP to take timely measures to contain the spread of any disease.Dr. Bhaskar Rajakumar, the Director of Healthcare at ARTPARK, highlighted the extensive effort put into the development of the related app. He mentioned,  Scientists have dedicated over a year to collect data and resources for the dashboard, while the app is the result of six months of rigorous work.  Leveraging a decade's worth of historical data, this module can forecast disease outbreaks four weeks in advance. Since most vector-borne diseases are sensitive to climate, scientists have gathered data from sources like the India Meteorological Department and the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre.Dr. Rajakumar told TOI,  We initially collected historical dengue data, details from fever clinics, serosurvey statistics, and genomic surveillance data, considering the potential mutation of the virus. Additionally, we analyzed data on people's mobility, changes in vegetation types, land use patterns, and topographical alterations to enhance prediction accuracy.  By extrapolating data from the previous decade to the actual incidence of cases in 2017 and 2018, the scientists achieved a remarkable 70% accuracy rate. They can now predict diseases down to the zonal level in Bengaluru and the sub-district level in the state. To further improve accuracy, the team aims to incorporate data from hospitals and testing labs into the dashboard.",

The event was also attended by health ministers of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Sikkim, Tripura along with senior officials from Meghalaya, Nagaland as well as other states of the region. The Union Minister of State for Ayush and Women & Child Development, Dr. Mahendrabhai Munjapara along with Secretary of Ministry of Ayush, Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha and other senior officials from the ministry, state governments were also present.Sonowal said, \u201cToday we had a very fruitful discussion on the promotion and propagation of Ayush system of medicine in the Northeast region of the country. Along with the rest of the world, the importance and popularity of traditional system of medicine has risen significantly in our beautiful region of Northeast. I must congratulate all our states in the region for taking onus in this regard as is evident from the progress we have achieved in propagating Ayush system of medicine in the region. Under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister, Narendra Modi ji, India has made significant progress in reinventing the age old and proven benefits of traditional system of medicine to enrich the quality of lives of the people. He further said,  Modi ji has not only encouraged the use of traditional medicine in India but has also led a global movement to invest, innovate and integrate traditional medicine with modern medicine to develop a holistic line of healthcare solutions aimed at enriching the quality of lives. In this spirit, I would like to call all the states of northeast India to explore the possibility of setting up an Integrated Ayush Department in all its leading state hospitals, in line with the setting up of similar departments in all 19 AIIMS, under the guidance of Prime Minister. Today, we are presented with this unique opportunity to kick start a movement to set up integrated medicine departments in all our leading state hospitals, thereby popularizing and implementing the concept of Integrated medicine to be emulated by the whole country. We, the people of Northeast region, can realize the vision of Modi ji as the engine of India\u2019s movement towards holistic healthcare, further boost the traditional medicine practices and become hub of an Ayush led economic growth, promoting employment & trade for the region.\u201dDuring the deliberations, the Health Minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Alo Libang said that the state is planning to set up a full fledged Directorate of Ayush Healthcare Services to promote traditional medicine in the Himalayan state. A Special Panchakarma Centre in the middle of Loktak lake was proposed to be set up, as confirmed by the Health Minister of Manipur, Dr Sapam Ranjan Singh. The Mizoram Health Minister, Dr R Lalthangliana also applauded the benefit of traditional medicine and how Ayush gram initiative and Jan Arogya Samiti is popularising the Ayush system of medicine in the state. Sonowal added, \u201cPM Narendra Modi led Government has approved for operationalisation of 12,500 Ayush Health & Wellness Centres (AHWCs) by the Ministry of Ayush through state governments as a component of Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) of National Ayush Mission (NAM) in a phased manner by 2023-24. The main objectives are to establish holistic wellness model based on AYUSH principles and practices, to empower masses for \u201cself care\u201d to reduce the disease burden, out of pocket expenditure and to provide informed choice to the needy public. Ministry of Ayush has released Rs. 449.64 crores to NE States under NAM from 2014-15 to 2022-23. Ministry has also supported 33 Integrated Ayush hospitals in NE states from 2014-15 to 2022-23 and out of that 09 are operational as reported by States. Out of 12,500 AHWCs,Ministry has supported 879AHWCs supported in NE States and out of that 492 are reported functional by the NE States.\u201dSarma said the North-eastern States can immensely contribute towards the further spread of practices such Ayurveda, yoga, naturopathy, unani and homeopathy among the residents of the country. Referring to Ayurveda, yoga, among others, as time-tested practices, Sarma said AYUSH is gradually rising in prominence as focus tilts towards holistic well-being.Sarma also stressed upon the need to capitalize on the opportunities that have been created with the recent mainstreaming of AYUSH practices across the country. He called upon the youths from across the country in general and those from the North-eastern States in particular to make the best use of the entrepreneurial opportunities the AYUSH sector is offering, while adding that at present, as many as 40,000 units of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are involved in production of AYUSH-related items and that the sector can accommodate a much greater number of production units owing to the steady increase in demand such products.Referring to the North-eastern region of the country as a treasure trove of economically-viable plants and herbs with medicinal properties, Sarma said the eight States of the region must strive to attain a status similar to that of Kerala in the field of tourism for traditional medicinal healing and cure. This would contribute towards growth of the tourism and hospitality industry and create a good number of employment opportunities in the region, he added.The Chief Minister expressed concern at the trend of AYUSH doctors and practitioners often prescribing allopathic medicine to their patients. This can be attributed to a lack of pride regarding AYUSH among some of the practitioners of alternative and traditional forms of medicines, Sarma said, adding it has now been proven through various research works that traditional forms of treatments such as Ayurveda, yoga, naturopathy is highly effective and have no side-effects as often seen in the use of allopathic medicines.Sarma exuded confidence the North-eastern States would emerge as one of the hotspots of AYUSH practices in days to come.",

A top official of his country will be visiting India very soon to address the issue of shortage of some crucial drugs including those for cancer in the US, he said.  We have a very strong and dependent relationship with India when it comes to pharmaceuticals. We depend on India, India depends on us and together we can both thrive when it comes to making sure medicines are available not just to our people but to the world,  Becerra told reporters here. He was in Gandhinagar to take part in the G20 Health Ministers' Meeting as well as bilateral meetings with other countries. The US is experiencing disruptions in the supply of some cancer drugs, he said. When asked if he has any plans to meet Indian officials or industry leaders to address the shortage of cancer drugs, Becerra said that is the reason why US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) Commissioner Robert Califf will be visiting India soon.  Because we don't want to see any shortage in supply of any medicines. There have been disruptions in the supply chain for some of the drugs for cancer. India is such an indispensable partner in helping America to have the pharmaceuticals that it needs,  Becerra said. The US is eyeing to increase the domestic capacity for the production of such crucial drugs, but still, it will not be enough, he said.  Strong partners like India make it possible for us to provide our people with the medicines that they need,  he said. Asked about the concerns raised by a US committee about the quality of medicines coming from India, the health secretary clearly said the US wanted the drugs sold in the country to be safe.  We want the drugs sold in our country safe and effective. This applies in India also. I don't see the regulatory regime which the US uses as a challenge (for Indian companies). It is a standard if Indian companies wish to sell products in the US. If India wants to make sure that they have companies which can meet those standards, we are absolutely willing to work with them,  he said. The US standards are transparent, he said, adding that his country wants India to continue to be a  good partner in the exchange of pharmaceuticals .  That requires Indian companies to meet US standards, if they wish to export to us,  Becerra said. He also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that India's role in the healthcare sector has expanded after the COVID-19 pandemic.  We can not let another world crisis, a pandemic, hit us, like Covid did. We know we have to work together. By the way, this is where India's role has increased dramatically. I think Prime Minister Narendra Modi recognizes, people also recognize that India is at a different place than it was a few decades ago. And this is the time when India can show that it is a world leader in this space,  he said. When asked if the US has made up its mind to onboard the digital health platform to be presented by India during the G20 meeting, the secretary said the discussions are still going on because it can prove to be  very dangerous  sans clear standards or road map.  Well, we certainly understand the importance of having digital platforms, especially now with AI really coming into play....At the same time we have to have standards in place so that we don't let those same technologies be used to harm our people. And so, all those are the considerations that people are working on,  he said. Without clear standards or roadmap, such an initiative  could be very dangerous if we don't have the ability to really know how we're going to use this , Becerra added.",

Co-hosted by the government of India, the summit will also explore ways to realise the potential of evidence-based knowledge in the use of traditional medicine for people's health and well-being around the world, the statement issued by the WHO said. WHO director-general and regional directors, G20 health ministers and high-level invitees from countries across the WHO's six regions will participate in the summit. Scientists, practitioners of traditional medicine, health workers and members of civil society organisations will also take part in it. The summit will explore ways to scale up scientific advances and realise the potential of evidence-based knowledge in the use of traditional medicine for people's health and well-being around the world, the statement said. Scientists and other experts will lead technical discussions on research, evidence and learning; policy, data and regulation; innovation and digital health; and biodiversity, equity and indigenous knowledge, it said.  Traditional medicine can play an important and catalytic role in achieving the goal of universal health coverage and meeting global health-related targets that were off-track even before the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,  said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.  Bringing traditional medicine into the mainstream of healthcare -- appropriately, effectively, and above all, safely based on the latest scientific evidence -- can help bridge access gaps for millions of people around the world. It would be an important step toward people-centered and holistic approaches to health and well-being.  Heads of state and government at the 2019 UN high-level meeting on universal health coverage acknowledged the need to include evidence-based traditional and complementary medicine services, particularly in primary health care, a cornerstone of health systems, in pursuit of health for all, the statement said.  Advancing science on traditional medicine should be held to the same rigorous standards as in other fields of health. This may require new thinking on the methodologies to address these more holistic, contextual approaches and provide evidence that is sufficiently conclusive and robust to lead to policy recommendations,  said Dr John Reeder, WHO Director of Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases and Director of Department of Research for Health. The summit will explore research and evaluation of traditional medicine, including methodologies that can be used to develop a global research agenda and priorities in traditional medicine, as well as challenges and opportunities based on 25 years of research in traditional medicine.",

On July 28, a five-year-old girl abducted from Aluva in Ernakulam District was brutally raped and killed allegedly by a migrant worker from Bihar. The child's family too hails from the same state. In another incident, on August 4, Malappuram police arrested a 36-year-old man, a migrant labourer from Madhya Pradesh, for allegedly sexually abusing a minor child who also hails from there. State Labour Minister V Sivankutty said officials will ensure that no guest worker is left out from the portal.  The government will also consider setting up help desks at railway stations where guest workers arrive in large numbers,  the minister said in a release. The statewide launch of the portal and registration of guest workers will be held on August 7, the Labour department said. Contractors, who bring guest workers to the state, and employers can register the workers in the portal. It also allows workers to register themselves individually as well. The enrolling officer will examine the details entered in the portal 'athidhi.lc.kerala.gov.in' and issue a unique ID to each worker, the Labour Department said. The portal will collect information regarding the workers and ensure that they have social security, Labour Commissioner Arjun Pandian said. Sivankutty had earlier said that presently migrant workers are regulated according to provisions of the Inter-State Migrant Workers Act of 1979. He had also said that over five lakh migrant workers are registered under the Awas Health Insurance Scheme introduced for them, and the labour department will take steps to identify all unregistered workers and get them onboard as well.",

Senior advocate Devajit Saikia, her counsel, told PTI that the case has been filed at the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division) of Kamrup Metropolitan on Friday and it will be moved on September 26.  My client has claimed a defamation of Rs 10 crore against Gaurav Gogoi for various tweets on X. We have made it very clear that we never made any application to receive subsidy,  he added. Saikia further claimed that the process to seek subsidy has not been initiated at all and for which, a show cause notice was slapped on his client's firm on May 26 this year, followed by an email from the Ministry of Food Processing.  The approval for the project was given on November 22, 2022. In the last email, we were told that our claim would lapse if we didn't submit our proposal. We are not responding to anything to seek subsidy,  he added. Whatever Gogoi stated on social media about Sarma and her entity 'Pride East Entertainments', that information was not based on facts, claimed the senior advocate.  He (Gogoi) did not do his homework. Getting approval for a project does not mean that a subsidy has been received. We will fight the case tooth and nail,  he asserted. A huge controversy erupted after Guwahati-based digital media 'The Crosscurrent' published a report alleging that over 50 bigha (nearly 17 acres) of agricultural land at Darigaji village in Kaliabor in Nagaon district was reclassified as industrial land within a month after it was bought by Pride East Entertainments, in which the chief minister's wife is the chairman and managing director. Following this, Gogoi, in a series of tweets for several days, brought allegations of corruption against Sarma and his wife in getting central government subsidy for the project. The Deputy Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha sought the intervention of Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal in bringing facts out in the open regarding subsidy for the project under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) and Scheme for Creation of Infrastructure for Agro Clusters. The Assam MP also pointed out that on March 22, 2023, Goyal in a reply to questions in Lok Sabha on the government's initiative to invest in Assam in order to support the promotion of industries, provided a list of food processing projects supported under the component of PMKSY as on January 31, 2022.  At Serial No 7 of the list, the name of M/S Pride East Entertainment Pvt Ltd has been mentioned. Pertinently, the amount of approved Grant-in-Aid is mentioned as Rs 10 crore. The list of beneficiaries can also be found on the website of the Ministry of Food Processing Industries,  he added. The PM Kisan Sampada Yojana is a comprehensive package which aims to create modern infrastructure with efficient supply chain management from farm gate to retail outlet. Gogoi's claims were vehemently challenged by the chief minister, who was engaged in a prolonged duel with the Congress leader on X. His wife had threatened to sue the MP alleging defamation.",

The government on August 9 announced it would sell an additional 50 lakh tonne of wheat and 25 lakh tonne of rice under the OMSS to bulk users. Wheat is being sold through weekly e-auction at a reserve price of Rs 2,125 per quintal, which is at par with the current minimum support price.  The successful implementation of the OMSS policy has ensured that the prices of wheat are kept under control in the open market, and sufficient stock of wheat is available in the central pool for the continuation of OMSS policy for the remaining period of 2023-24,  the food ministry said in a statement. Till September 21, a total of 13 e-auctions have been conducted, wherein 18.09 lakh tonne of wheat has been sold under the scheme, it said. A quantity of 2 lakh tonne of wheat is being offered in each weekly auction across the country from more than 480 depots during the year 2023-24, it said. The ministry said the weighted average selling price of wheat in the e-auction was Rs 2,254.71 per quintal in August, which has come down to Rs 2,163.47 per quintal on September 20.  The downward trend in the weighted average selling price of wheat suggests that the market prices of wheat have cooled down in the open market,  the statement said. In each weekly e-auction conducted, the quantity sold has not crossed 90 per cent of the quantity offered, which shows that sufficient stocks of wheat are being offered across the country, it added.",

The calibrated measures taken by the Government, including adjustments in the duties of many critical inputs and monetary policy tightening, helped to reduce core inflation,  the DEA said in its report. In its report, the department specified that the government's targeted measures for specific crops, including build-up of buffer, procurement from producing centres and subsidized distribution enabled easing of inflation in the country.Amid growing food inflation in major economies inter alia France, Germany, Japan, South Africa, and UK, India on the other hand saw a dip in its retail inflation. As of August, consumer food price inflation eased to 9.9 per cent from 11.5 per cent in July. Vegetable inflation, however, surged in both July and August due to various factors including a sudden price rise in tomatoes and other food items, due to crop specific and weather-related factors like rain deficiency in the country. Nonetheless, the average inflation during April-August 2023, was 5.6 per cent, which is within the RBI tolerance limit of 2-6 per cent.   103856876Meanwhile, the economy's outlook report highlighted that the monsoon deficit in August could impact both Kharif and Rabi crops which requires assessment. However, it is a relief that the monsoon deficit of August has been partially plugged in September, the report added. Despite a 10 per cent deficient monsoon this year, vis-a-vis June-September, The kharif sowing (excluding cotton) is 0.8 per cent higher than the corresponding period last year, as of September 15. As per the economic review, normal or excess rains were received in around 83 per cent of the country\u2019s area. While the sown area under pulses and oil seeds remains lower than year ago period, the sowing of kharif rice has emerged as major contributor to the growth with 2.7 per cent higher than 2022.   103856936The DEA's outlook did mention an emerging concern which is the recent run-up in oil prices.  But, no alarms yet,  it said. Oil prices hovered near 10-month highs this week, as a bigger-than-expected draw in US oil stockpiles along with weak US shale output reinforcing fears of tight crude supply for the rest of 2023.Global benchmark Brent crude futures climbed 6 cents, or 0.1%, to $94.40 a barrel on September 20, staying near the highest since November of $95.96 hit on the previous day.Earlier this week, industry data showed U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell last week by about 5.25 million barrels, Reuters reported. As per a Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. rejoined the $100-a-barrel oil club, raising its forecast for crude back to triple digits as worldwide demand hits unprecedented levels and OPEC+ supply curbs continue to tighten the market.The DEA's outlook remains bright for FY24 amid continued momentum in economic activity.  In sum, we remain comfortable with our 6.5 per cent real GDP growth estimate for FY24 with symmetric risks,  it said. ",

Deliveries were only being made on previously agreed prices to Iraq, Philippines and Malaysia, the trader added. Vietnam's 5% broken rice prices retreated to $620-$630 from $630-$640 last week. Buyers from the Philippines remained quiet, a Ho Chi Minh City-based trader said.

In July, the consumer price index based retail inflation spiked to 15-month high of 7.44 per cent in July, with specific food commodities mainly driving the increase.  Speaking at the 'Monthly Asia-Pacific Credit Focus' webinar, Rana said in India the monsoon has been very patchy and overall rain was about 11 per cent below normal.   That is a significant concern as it can affect grain prices in India over next few months,  he said.  The government has already imposed export curbs on rice and levied a 40 per cent export duty on onions to make available enough stock in local market ahead of the festive season.   Supplies remain very strong and the government is likely to step in to prevent significant increase in commodity, wheat and rice prices. It will help to keep food price inflation little bit low,  Rana said.  Tomato prices, which had skyrocketed in July, had started cooling in late August.  The significant spike in vegetable prices is coming down, Rana said.   Overall, the inflation environment for India will depend on energy prices. Food prices will remain elevated but is unlikely to go up because of public policies. We expect overall inflation to remain elevated but not rising further for India over the next few months,  Rana added.  The finance ministry in its monthly report had last month said that price pressure on food items is expected to be transitory, but the government and RBI need to step up vigil to deal with elevated inflationary pressure.  Going forward, while domestic consumption and investment demand are expected to continue driving growth, global and regional uncertainties and domestic disruptions may keep inflationary pressures elevated for the coming months, warranting greater vigilance by the government and the RBI, it had said.",

India, the world\u2019s top rice shipper, has now restricted exports of every variety of the staple. It is also selling tomatoes, onions and grains from state reserves to improve local supplies.But Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra said in an interview on Friday that thanks to ample grain reserves, plus an imminent new rice crop, the country\u2019s situation was not worrisome. Normal to above-normal rains are also forecast in many areas this month, offsetting the impact of disruptions including the driest August in more than a century.\u201cThe government has taken many steps to ensure the food security of the country,\u201d Chopra said. \u201cAs of now, there are no proposals for any further export curbs,\u201d he said, adding restrictions had already served their purpose.Government stockpiles of rice and wheat are sufficient to run food and other welfare programs, while procurement of rice from the 2023-24 harvest will begin in October, boosting state reserves further. The government will, though, monitor stockpiles of pulses and other foods held by traders to stop hoarding.Wheat Duties Local wheat supplies are also adequate to meet demand in the world\u2019s second-biggest producer and consumer, Chopra said, adding that the government hadn\u2019t taken any decision yet on whether to scrap import duties, a move that would make purchases from overseas more attractive.\u201cAll options are open,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are monitoring the situation. In case we feel that there is any kind of requirement, then the government will exercise the option which is appropriate at that point in time.\u201dAsked about supplies from Russia \u2014 the top exporter, selling from a bumper crop \u2014 Chopra said there had been no conversations regarding government-to-government import deals.While food prices are likely to remain in the headlines as elections near, there are other indications that pressures are easing. Last week, Chief Economic Advisor V. Anantha Nageswaran said food inflation in India was likely to subside with the arrival of fresh stocks, while the core inflation rate is declining.Chopra said markets and consumers should not expect any spikes in prices: \u201cWe are giving that signal.\u201d",

Even though food inflation is high in general, some key ingredients that are used for making traditional Indian sweets are cheaper from a year earlier, which will help in containing the prices, he said. While the prices of dry fruits have gone up 10-12% over last year, palm oil, which is extensively used for deep frying during the festivity, costs less than last year, adding to the advantage of the sweet makers and consumers. The price of another key ingredient - milk - has remained stable in the wholesale market, making other important dairy items such as mawa, chena and ghee also affordable.103221560The price of sugar is also only marginally up.

A final decision will be taken by Modi\u2019s office in the coming months, they added. The extra cost is expected to be nominal and can be met through this year\u2019s budget allocation, the people said. The initiative was launched in December last year to provide free grains to about 800 million people until end-2023. Extending the program until June next year coincides with the national vote that must be held by summer. Modi has polled above 60% in opinion surveys and is likely to lead his party to victory though there\u2019s some voter discontent over rising unemployment and higher living costs. A spokesperson from the Finance Ministry did not respond to a request for a comment. The free grains program has in part helped Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party to stay ahead of the opposition in the South Asian country, which accounts for nearly 30% of the world\u2019s low-income population. The party and its allies won elections in seven out of the ten state polls so far this year and there are five more due before the year ends.Prolonging the program could help rein in inflation, which jumped to a 15-month high last month. Uneven monsoon rains and drier weather conditions could affect crop production, prompting the government to ban some exports of rice varieties and restrict stockpiling of food commodities. ",

Domestic consumption and investment demand are expected to continue to spur economic growth, it said.102955481The report stated that the maintenance of macroeconomic stability is paramount to keep interest rates from rising too much and to maintain steady economic growth. This would underscore the \u201crelative attractiveness of India as a zone of performance and promise for domestic and international investors\u201d. \u201cIn the given circumstances, policies that contribute to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability constitute macroeconomic stimulus,\u201d it added.This is particularly important at a time when stock prices have started correcting as sovereign bond yields have risen in much of the advanced world in August. Also, geopolitical and geo-economic concerns have not abated, and they may be \u201can enduring reality for quite some time\u201d, he added.Rural demand sustained sequential momentum in the June quarter, as reflected in the sales of fast moving consumer goods and two-and-three-wheelers. Increased minimum support prices and prospects of healthy kharif crops will further add strength to the rural demand going forward, it added.Driven by a spike in price pressure in food, retail inflation hit a 15-month peak of 7.44% in July but core inflation stayed at a 39-month low.\u201cRussia\u2019s decision to terminate the Black Sea Grain deal, along with dry conditions in major wheat-growing areas, caused the price spike in cereals. While domestic factors like white fly disease and uneven monsoon distribution exerted pressure on vegetable prices in India,\u201d the report said.The external sector, however, requires a closer watch to strengthen merchandise export growth in the face of slowing global demand, it said. Services exports continue to do well and are likely to continue to put up a good show as the preference for remote working remains unabated, typically manifested in the proliferation of global capability centres.",

We had planned to complete the universalisation of fortified PDS rice by March 2024. But, with the pace of distribution, we are hopeful of reaching the target before that and the entire PDS (rice) will be fortified ...in the next few months,  Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra told reporters here.  As of date, he said the Food Corporation of India (FCI) has 240 lakh tonnes of rice, of which just 12 lakh tonnes is non-fortified rice.  Chopra also asserted that fortified rice is safe for people with sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia.  He explained that through PDS fortified rice only 7 mg per day of iron will be consumed while the human body can take 40-45 mg per day of iron.  The secretary said the government will also look at revising the advisory on fortified rice being harmful to people with sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia in light of new evidence.  Globally, Chopra said, 90 countries are using fortification of food items.  The Department of Food and Public Distribution organised a one-day National Seminar on Rice Fortification here.  While addressing the seminar, Chopra said,  We are on track to achieve the target of 100 per cent distribution of fortified rice across all rice-consuming districts in the country.   As per the plan, in the first phase, the target was to cover ICDS and PM POSHAN in India by March 2022.  Under the second phase, the plan was to extend the scheme to beneficiaries of PDS and other welfare schemes in all aspirational and high-burden districts on stunting (a total of 291 districts) by March 2023.  In the third phase, the target was to cover the remaining districts of the country by March 2024.  In April this year, Chopra informed that a total of 269 districts in 27 states started distributing fortified rice under PDS, achieving a 100 per cent target set for Phase II by March 2023.  The ministry has also developed Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) for adherence to Quality Assurance (QA) & Quality Control (QC) protocols on the production and distribution of fortified rice/ FRKs (fortified rice kernels).  Food regulator FSSAI, the regulatory/licensing authority for food fortification, has drafted standards for FRK and Pre-mix, and provided direction to all the stakeholders for the operationalisation of draft standards with immediate effect.",

        "description": "India is reportedly in talks with Russia to import wheat at a discounted price to counter surging global prices and tackle food inflation.

Last time India imported a significant amount of wheat was in 2017, when private traders shipped in 5.3 million metric tons. ",

        "articleBody": "India is in talks with Russia to import wheat at a discount to surging global prices in a rare move to boost supplies and curb food inflation ahead of state and national elections next year, according to four sources. The imports would allow New Delhi to intervene more effectively in the market to drive down wheat prices that stoked inflation to a 15-month high in July.  The government is exploring the possibility of imports through private trade and government-to-government deals. The decision will be made cautiously,  one of the sources told Reuters, when asked about wheat imports from Russia. India has not imported wheat through diplomatic deals in years. The last time India imported a significant amount of wheat was in 2017, when private traders shipped in 5.3 million metric tons. The government's plan to import Russian wheat is one of the supply-side measures being considered to bring down prices of key commodities like fuel, cereals and pulse along with an extension of rural schemes to ease the impact of inflation on the poor, two of the sources with knowledge of the matter said. Sources did not want to be named as the discussions are private and the final decision might be weeks away. India's finance, trade and government spokespersons did not reply to emails and messages seeking comment. Last month, Sanjeev Chopra, the most senior civil servant at the federal food ministry, said there was no proposal to import wheat from Russia. LOW WHEAT STOCKS Although India needs only 3 million to 4 million metric tons of wheat to plug the shortfall, New Delhi might consider importing 8 million to 9 million tons of wheat from Russia to have a far bigger impact on prices, another source said. Since the war in Ukraine last year, Russia has become India's second biggest seller of goods mainly on account of discounted oil purchases by New Delhi.  Russia has indicated its willingness to offer a discount on prevailing market prices. There are no restrictions on the export of food commodities from Russia,  one official said. India is also importing sunflower oil from Russia and settling payments in U.S. dollars and is planning to use the same approach, the official added.  India can easily secure a discount of $25 to $40 per ton from Russia. This will ensure that the landed cost of wheat remains significantly below local prices,  said a dealer based in Mumbai with a global trade house. Wholesale wheat prices in India surged around 10% over two months to a seven-month high in August on limited supplies. Wheat stocks at government warehouses were at 28.3 million tons on Aug. 1, 20% below the 10-year average.  Last year, India banned wheat exports due to lower output, and this year's crop is also expected to be at least 10% lower than the government's estimate.",

The increasing prices may prompt New Delhi to eliminate import duties on the cereal to bolster supplies and control prices ahead of key state polls and next year's general election. Rising wheat prices could contribute to food inflation and potentially complicate the efforts of both the government and the central bank to contain inflation.  In all key producing states, farmer supplies have nearly come to a halt. Flour mills are struggling to obtain sufficient supplies in the market,  said a New Delhi-based trader. Wheat prices at Indore in the central state of Madhya Pradesh rose by 1.5% on Tuesday to 25,446 rupees ($307.33) per metric ton, the highest since Feb. 10. Prices have surged by nearly 18% over the past four months. The government should release stocks from its warehouses into the open market to avoid potential shortages during the festive season, said a Mumbai-based dealer associated with a global trade house. As of August 1, wheat stocks in government warehouses stood at 28.3 million metric tons, an increase from the 26.6 million metric tons recorded a year earlier.  Imports are necessary to lower prices. The government cannot increase supplies without imports,  the dealer said. India is considering cutting or even abolishing a 40% import tax on wheat and lowering a limit on the amount of wheat stocks millers and traders can hold, Sanjeev Chopra, the most senior civil servant at the federal food ministry, said last week. Wheat output rose to a record 112.74 million metric tons in 2023, up from 107.7 million metric tons a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. India consumes around 108 million metric tons of wheat annually.

Indian economy\u2019s domestic dynamics continue to be strong. Real GDP growth data for the last quarter of FY23 reaffirmed the ability of the Indian economy to grow on the strength of its domestic demand and investment despite a rise in global uncertainties and moderation in global output,  it said in its monthly economic report for June. Growth momentum gathered in this quarter is likely to be sustained in the June 2023 quarter. However, price of such stability and growth is eternal policy vigilance, it noted.On inflation, the ministry said that inflationary pressure has significantly declined in the June 2023 quarter compared to the corresponding quarter last year and has entered the tolerance band of the RBI. But surge in food prices has led to sequential increase in food inflation in the month of June. The core inflation has also been softening since the beginning of the June 2023 quarter, indicating a restoration of overall price stability in the economy. However, the recent spike in the prices of \u2018fruits,\u2019 \u2018vegetables,\u2019 and \u2018pulses and products owing to weather-related disruptions has led to a sequential increase in food inflation for the month of June 2023. As inflation has been reined in only recently while threats of supply-side shocks, including El Nino, persist, the RBI and the government continue to be guarded for appropriate and timely policy response,  it said.The report also outlined the importance of fiscal consolidation along with narrowing of current account deficit for avoiding the challenge of a rising twin deficit. The government's progress towards achieving its fiscal target for the year, along with the presence of favourable external sector indicators during the June 2023 quarter, reaffirm the macroeconomic stability of the economy. While both the merchandise exports and imports contracted during the June 2023 quarter, the decline in imports was larger than the fall in exports in absolute terms, leading to a narrower merchandise trade deficit on a YoY basis. A smaller merchandise trade deficit and a consistent service trade surplus augur well for a narrower current account deficit in relation to GDP during the June 2023 quarter,  the review said.Despite adverse global developments, India\u2019s exports are also expected to perform well, driven by strong performance in services exports, the report further said. Increased digitisation drive, growing preference for remote working and increased proliferation of Global Capability Centres are expected to further increase India\u2019s services exports. Accompanied with an easing of supply chains and a decline in global commodity prices, the trade deficit is expected to improve further in the coming year. ",

Coupled with the new season crop that is due to start trickling into the market by October, the surplus will raise market hopes of New Delhi relaxing a recent export ban. The world's biggest rice exporter last month ordered a surprise halt to non-basmati white rice exports, its largest category, driving prices to multi-year highs. Indian rice stocks, including unmilled husk varieties at state warehouses, totalled 37.6 million metric tons on Aug 1, the sources told Reuters.  We are quite comfortable in rice,  said one of the sources, who asked not to be identified.  We are in the tail end of the 2022-23 rice marketing year, and as you can see, our stocks are more than adequate. And then the next crop the round the corner.  Stocks held as of Aug 1 include 24.6 million metric tons of rice and 13 million metric tons of the unmilled variety, the sources said. State-run warehouses must have 13.5 million metric tons of rice, including strategic reserves of 2 million metric tons for the quarter beginning July 1, according to local government rules. Indian farmers, who typically start planting rice in the rainy months of June and July, will start harvesting the new season crop from October. New season purchases by India's state-run Food Corporation of India (FC), the main state-run grain buyer, would bump up rice inventories at state granaries. FCI bought 84.6 million metric tons of rice paddy from domestic farmers during the 2022-23 marketing year, yielding around 57 million metric tons of rice. Indian farmers harvested a record 135.5 million metric tons of rice in 2022-23, according to the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. Indian farmers have planted 23.7 million hectares with summer-sown rice so far, according to the farm ministry's latest data, up 1.71% year-on-year, as crucial monsoon rains revived in July and helped farmers accelerate sowing. India is likely to receive below-average rainfall in August due to the El Nino weather pattern, after an above-average monsoon in July helped farmers accelerate crop planting. Still, rice-growing states in eastern India could receive surplus rainfall in August, according to the weather office.  A good crop would force FCI to buy large quantities of rice from farmers, further boosting stocks at government granaries, B.V. Krishna Rao, president of the Rice Exporters Association, told Reuters. The export ban would increase domestic supplies and bring down rice paddy prices to the government-set support or guaranteed price of Rs 2,183 per 100 kg, compelling FCI to buy more, he said.  The government is already holding more rice than required under buffer norms,  Rao said referring to the state-set target.",

        "articleBody": "India G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant on Thursday made a strong case for food waste prevention programmes globally to reduce food insecurity and mobilise private funding for research in sustainable agriculture. Kant was addressing the maiden Global Food Regulators Summit 2023 here.  This is the first time a meeting of this nature is being held during India's G20 presidency. We feel strongly that locally adapted crops are significant for the transition towards resilient agriculture and food systems,  he said. To strengthen research, collaboration and public awareness of green crops, the G20 in its agriculture ministerial meeting, launched millet and other ancient grains international research initiative called Maharishi. The former bureaucrat said the world is passing through a critical time as one-third of the world is in recession, and 75 countries of the world are facing a global debt crisis. Also, there is a major crisis of food, fuel and fertiliser in several countries.  The need of the hour is not only to focus on the immediate crisis and short-term measures but also for all countries to make their food systems more resilient in the long run,  he said and urged the global food regulators to consider encouraging the cultivation of alternative crops beyond the major grains. He also talked about India's initiatives to popularise the use of millet. He informed that not a single meal is served at programs being held during India's presidency. This, he said, is being done to promote alternative crops. He further said:  It is important to mobilise private funding towards research and development in climate resilient and sustainable agriculture...it's important to ensure the protection of the most vulnerable groups through targeted social protection programmes such as food subsidies . Kant also emphasised the increasing cooperation among government, private businesses and international partners, so that nutritious production systems, which ensure proper food security, are taken care of.  It's also important to implement food waste prevention programmes to reduce food insecurity. There is just too much food wastage in the world,  he said. India's G20 Sherpa stressed on the deployment of digital tools to enhance agricultural practices, such as using soil maps to increase the efficient use of fertiliser. He urged the gathering to utilise the summit platform for learning, strengthening networks to improve food safety and creating a mechanism for investing in food safety in a sustainable way. This summit is an endeavour of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) under the aegis of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) to create a global platform of food regulators to exchange perspectives on strengthening food safety systems and regulatory framework across the food value chain.",

He also inaugurated the extension of the Delhi Metro's Airport Line which now terminates at YashoBhoomi Dwarka Sector 25 station.Secretary in the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Rajesh Kumar Singh said that it is India's largest complex and it would help India tap the growing MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) industry.India's share is less than 1 per cent of the Rs 25 lakh crore MICE sector. Bharat Mandapam at Pragati Maidan and Yashobhoomi would help in capturing more share in the sector.India ranked 28th with 158 meetings in 2019 International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) list because of less number of events being organised in the country.In cities, Delhi ranked at 75th out of 475.Talking about the next phase of the ICC project, Singh said that now they are in a position to use Yashobhoomi to attract private players to participate in the phase-II of the IICC project. We will do that in PPP mode. We will soon start the bidding for that. We will do it in a phased manner to start with. We will start with hotels,  he told reporters here.He added that nine three- and five-star hotels, and retail space are planned under the phase-II project.Speaking at the briefing, KINEXIN CEO Phil Chung said that many countries are trying to come to India and the IICC project will increase demand for customers.

Phase-II will include three exhibition complexes, arena, hotels, retail and office spaces.The complete project is planned over an area of 221.37 acres at Dwarka Sector 25 at an estimated cost of Rs 25,703 crore. The total area of the project is more than Bharat Mandapam's 123 acres.It is expected that the centre will bring New Delhi into the league of Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore in the sphere of the exhibition market, according to the commerce and industry ministry.While Bharat Mandapam comes under the Department of Commerce, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is implementing the convention and expo centre through its fully-owned entity IICC.Within Asia, China accounts for more than 68 per cent (4.1 million sq m) of the total available space for exhibition facilities, while India has only 0.3 million sq m, accounting for 4.9 per cent of the share of Asia.In terms of events hosted across Asian markets, Chinese venues took the lead by hosting more than 515 (28 per cent) events in Asia annually, as compared to Indian venues hosting 131 events (7.1 per cent).The absence of high-end world-class exhibitions and conference facilities had dented India's abilities in this space.",

        "articleBody": "The government has issued mandatory quality norms for solder wires, used in electronics and engineering industry, to curb the import of sub-standard goods and boost domestic manufacturing of these goods. A notification in this regard was issued by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) on September 18.  Items under Flux Cored Solder Wire (Quality Control) Order, 2023 cannot be produced, sold, traded, imported and stocked unless they bear the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) mark.  These orders will come into force with effect from six months from the date of publication of this notification, the DPIIT said on Tuesday.  Soldering is a critical process where quality of flux cored solder wire is of paramount importance as any failure will impact quality and safety of the products soldered particularly in electronic and automobile industry.   The implementation of the Quality Control Order (QCO) for this product is crucial not only for the safety of consumers, but will also improve the manufacturing quality standards in the country and curb imports of sub-standard products into India,  it added.  Till now, BIS certification rules were not applicable on these products.  Violation of the provision of the BIS Act can attract imprisonment of up to two years, or a fine of at least Rs 2 lakh for the first offence.  In case of second and subsequent offences, the fine will increase to a minimum of Rs 5 lakh and extend up to 10 times of the value of goods or articles.  According to the notification, to support domestic micro and small industries, relaxations have been granted in terms of the timeline for implementing the QCO.  Various initiatives, including the development of QCO, are being undertaken by the department to develop quality sensitisation among users and manufacturers alike.  These initiatives, coupled with developing quality testing labs and product manuals, would help build a quality ecosystem in the country, it said.  Mandatory QCOs help curb import of sub-standard products, prevent unfair trade practices, and ensure safety and well-being of consumers, as well as the environment.  These initiatives, coupled with development of testing labs, product manuals, accreditation of test labs would aid the development of a quality ecosystem in the country.   The objective of notifying the QCOs is to enhance quality of the domestically manufactured products, curb the imports of sub-standard products into India, prevention of unfair trade practices, protection of human, animal or plant health and safety of the environment,  it said.  Earlier, such orders have been issued for several goods such as smart meters, welding rods and electrodes, cookware and utensils, fire extinguishers, electric ceiling fans and domestic gas stoves.   DPIIT, in continuous consultation with BIS, and stakeholders has been identifying key products for requiring implementation of QCO. This has led to the initiation of development of 60 new QCOs covering 318 product standards,  the department added.",

        "articleBody": "The government-backed Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) has expanded its reach into the international business-to-business marketplace by partnering with the Singapore-based B2B network Proxtera.With this move, ONDC, an initiative of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), aims to establish connections between small and medium enterprises (SMEs), logistics services and payment transfers, facilitating seamless export opportunities for Indian businesses. The demonstration today is a step towards enabling digital market access across borders for Indian businesses and SMEs and Proxtera, as the first international buyer app from Singapore,  Thampy Koshy, MD and CEO, ONDC, said at the Global SME Finance Forum held on Thursday.Proxtera, a B2B marketplace network backed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), becomes the inaugural international B2B buyer app integrated with ONDC.Two seller networks, SignCatch, with the platform Bech.app, and Rapidor, with placeorder.com, are set to execute the first international B2B trade with ONDC. ET previously reported that these companies have joined the government-backed platform for their first B2B transaction.\u201cONDC has made a foundational public infrastructure and we should open up different services like logistics, financing, transfer of payments and whatever it takes. I think that\u2019s where we want the journey to continue,\u201d said Sopnendu Mohanty, chief financial officer, MAS.The roles played by SignCatch and Rapidor on the seller side in bridging the gaps in cross-border trade are instrumental in their journey, he added.Mohanty, however, stressed on the need for strategies to reduce the foreign exchange (FX) costs associated with cross-border trade.\u201cBeyond marketplace discovery, I will strongly recommend that we should think about how to reduce the cost of FX, because a big part of the cross-border trade will be in the FX component. The PayNow and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) connectivity will now come very handy to integrate to the payment rails.\u201d\u201cAlso, legal disputes and resolutions are a big part of cross-border trade and Singapore has a quite matured and vibrant dispute resolution centre, and we can use that as centres to solve problems and challenges when it comes to disputes,  he added.Earlier this year, India's UPI and Singapore's PayNow payment systems were integrated, enabling faster and more cost-efficient cross-border remittances for users from both countries.Mohanty said ONDC\u2019s public infrastructure welcomes participants of all sizes, eliminating barriers for SMEs to join the network. He believes that this collaboration will serve as a template for SMEs globally, presenting an opportunity to make a more substantial impact.",

        "articleBody": "The government has issued mandatory quality norms for solar cable and cast iron products to curb the import of sub-standard goods and boost domestic manufacturing of these goods. A notification in this regard was issued by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) on August 25.  Items under Solar DC Cable and Fire Survival Cable (Quality Control) Order, 2023; and Cast Iron Products (Quality Control) Order, 2023 cannot be produced, sold, traded, imported and stocked unless they bear the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) mark.  This order includes electric cable for photovoltaic systems. These cables can be used indoor and outdoor for flexible and fixed installations with high mechanical strength in extreme weather conditions.  Fire cables are designed to sustain the high temperatures for a defined minimum period of time under direct fire. It is used in nuclear power plants, airports, metro rails, refineries, high rise buildings, shopping malls and cinema theatres.  These orders will come into force with effect from six months from the date of publication of this notification, the DPIIT said.  Till now, BIS certification rules were not applicable on these products.  Violation of the provision of the BIS Act can attract imprisonment of up to two years or a fine of at least Rs 2 lakh for the first offence.  In case of second and subsequent offences, the fine will increase to a minimum of Rs 5 lakh and extend up to 10 times the value of goods or articles.  According to the notification, to support domestic micro and small industries, relaxations have been granted in terms of the timeline for implementing the Quality Control Order (QCO).  Various initiatives, including the development of QCO, are being undertaken by the department to develop quality sensitisation among users and manufacturers alike.  These initiatives, coupled with developing quality testing labs and product manuals, would help build a quality ecosystem in the country, it said.  Mandatory QCOs help curb import of sub-standard products, prevent unfair trade practices, and ensure safety and well-being of consumers, as well as the environment.   QCOs shall not only improve the manufacturing quality standards in the country but also enhance the brand and value of Made in India products,  it said.  These initiatives, coupled with development testing labs, product manuals, accreditation of test labs would aid in the development of a quality ecosystem in India.  The standard issued for any product is for voluntary compliance unless it is notified by the central government to make it mandatory primarily through notification of Quality Control Order (QCO) under Scheme-I and Compulsory Registration Order (CRO) under Scheme-II of BIS Conformity Assessment Regulations, 2018.   The objective of notifying the QCOs is to enhance quality of the domestically manufactured products, curb the imports of sub-standard products into India, prevention of unfair trade practices, protection of human, animal or plant health and safety of the environment,  it said.  Earlier, such orders have been issued for several goods such as smart meters, welding rods and electrodes, cookware and utensils, fire extinguishers, electric ceiling fans and domestic gas stoves.   DPIIT in continuous consultation with BIS and stakeholders has been identifying key products for requiring implementation of QCO. This has led to the initiation of development of 60 new QCOs covering 318 product standards,  the department added.",

It is also used as collateral in business transactions.The DPIIT plans to examine the IP financing models put in place by Singapore, the UK, South Korea, Malaysia, Japan, Thailand and Canada.The financing based on IPRs vested in patents, trademarks, designs and copyrights is expected to improve India's finances, boost financial innovation and lead to easy availability of credit and enhanced capital base.102917700 The value of intangible IP assets increases over time while those of tangible assets depreciate. It is an alternative to traditional financing,  a government official told ET.The plan is in line with the National Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy, which aims to  enable valuation of IP rights as intangible assets by application of appropriate methodologies and guidelines; facilitating securitisation of IP rights and their use as collateral by creation of enabling legislative, administrative and market framework .As per the department, creation of new financial instruments and technologies, new derivative contracts, corporate securities, or newer forms of pooled investment products for financing or raising loan, if claimed as IP rights, would become an alternative form of economic and financial tool. IP financing in India is at a nascent stage and so, intangible assets need to be protected and regulated,  the official said.The department plans to rope in a consultant to compile statistics related to IP application and registration, utilisation and volume of IP financing in the country, and examine the challenges, legal frameworks, and government policies supporting IP financing, and accounting standards determining the valuation of IPs.",

The ones where it has picked up speed include electronics, pharma, medical devices, telecom, food processing, and white goods.Efforts are on to solve issues like timely processing of claims, visa-related matters where vendors require Chinese professionals' expertise, and delay in getting environmental clearances that have been raised by the stakeholders of production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes.The PLI scheme was announced in 2021 for 14 sectors that included telecommunications, white goods, textiles, manufacturing of medical devices, automobiles, speciality steel, food products, high-efficiency solar PV modules, advanced chemistry cell battery, drones and pharma with an outlay of Rs 1.97 lakh crore.The scheme aims to attract investments in key sectors and cutting-edge technology; ensure efficiency and bring economies of size and scale in the manufacturing sector; and make Indian companies and manufacturers globally competitive.These schemes for all 14 sectors have been notified by the concerned ministries/ departments following due approval.

For this, DPIIT officials held a meeting in June with all selected survey agencies for assessing the cost of regulation.  The session was scheduled to provide orientation/brief to the overall project coordinator/key persons from all regions. Citing examples, the official said seeking a number of papers and delays in giving approvals or clearances cost to the industry.   The exercise is aimed at reducing this cost,  the official added.  The department is taking a series of measures to reduce the compliance burden of the industry and improve the ease of doing business. It has removed or simplified thousands of obsolete provisions and has rolled out a national single-window system for faster approvals and clearances.  The Centre has also decided to help states in simplification, rationalisation or decriminalisation of provisions.  Parliament has recently passed a bill which seeks to promote ease of business by decriminalising minor offences through amendments in 183 provisions of 42 Acts. The bill converts several fines to penalties, meaning that court prosecution is not necessary to administer punishments. It also removes imprisonment as a punishment for many offences.  A working group has been formed to take the initiative forward.

        "articleBody": "There are 3,085 recognised startups operating in India\u2019s financial technology sector (as of April 30), Parliament was informed on Monday. These startups are recognised under the Startup India initiative launched by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal trade (DPIIT), said Minister of state for corporate affairs (independent charge) Rao Inderjit Singh. He added that the government has launched several initiatives to bolster startups across a wide array of sectors, with a specific focus on fostering growth in the financial technology (fintech) domain.The minister added that DPIIT has recognised 98,119 entities as startups since the launch of Startup India in 2016. The government has notified a set of conditions for the startups to be recognised by the DPIIT, such as date of incorporation, revenue and profit benchmarks and number of employees. Recognised startups get certain fiscal and non-fiscal incentives announced by the government from time to time. \u201cTo promote our startup ecosystem, especially in the fintech sector, the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) has taken various measures,  Singh stated. Among these measures is the introduction of a distinct \u2018Fin-Tech Entity Framework\u2019, designed to cater to the needs of fintechs and techfins.Singh also highlighted that the IFSCA has introduced an incentive scheme tailored to fintechs and startups. This comprehensive scheme encompasses various grants, including startup grants, sandbox grants, proof-of-concept (PoC) grants, green fintech grants, listing grants, and accelerator grants.To enhance investment inflows within the fintech sector, the government has taken several strategic steps, including the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY). This initiative aims to amplify financial inclusion in India by streamlining the enrolment of beneficiaries in new bank accounts, facilitating direct benefit transfers, and granting access to a multitude of financial services applications. This, in turn, has enabled fintech startups to develop technological solutions that effectively cater to India's substantial consumer base, Singh noted.Furthermore, Singh emphasised the significance of the synergy between Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhar, and Mobile (collectively known as the JAM trinity), along with the Unified Payments Interface. This amalgamation has played a pivotal role in promoting technical inclusivity, transparency, integrity, and the timely delivery of financial benefits and services to the public, he said.In addition, the government of India also launched the Startup India initiative on January 16, 2016. The initiative aims to build a robust ecosystem to nurture innovation and startups, and encourage private investments in the country's startup ecosystem.",

        "articleBody": "As many as 16 social sector ministries, including Health and Panchayati Raj, have integrated their data on the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS-NMP) platform so far, the commerce and industry ministry said on Friday. The platform was launched in 2021 to develop an integrated infrastructure to reduce logistic costs. The plan is to create a technology-based tool for effective and integrated infrastructure development in the country. All logistics and connectivity infrastructure projects, entailing an investment of over Rs 500 crore, are routed through the Network Planning Group (NPG), constituted under the PM Gati Shakti initiative.   As of date, sixteen social sector ministries/ departments have been fully onboarded onto PMGS-NMP, with individual portals developed and integrated with the NMP,  the ministry said.  These ministries include rural development, health, post, higher education, culture, housing and urban affairs, women and child development, tribal affairs, and sports.   As a way ahead, action points were emphasized for necessary action by social sector ministries for wider adoption of the NMP in social sector planning,  it said.  The action points include integration of essential data layers with the NMP to be completed in mission mode; list of schemes/ programs to be identified that can be integrated with PMGS; and promote wider adoption of PMGS in social sector planning for last and first mile delivery and improved access to services, duly involving field level functionaries. It added that so far 87 data layers related to infrastructure assets, such as primary health centres, dump sites, primary and secondary schools, colleges, district hospitals, public toilets, fair and dairy locations have been mapped on the NMP.  These all issues were discussed in a review meeting of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) on August 1 here.  More than 50 officers from 22 social sector ministries participated in the meeting.  DPIIT Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh highlighted the immense utility of the platform in social sector planning and the need for efforts to be made at district level for the benefits to percolate at grassroot level.",

Secretary in the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Rajesh Kumar Singh said that Parliament passed a bill which seeks to promote ease of business by decriminalising minor offences through amendments in 183 provisions of 42 Acts.   We will do this in the future as well...We intend to follow with an inter-ministerial working group which will look at other provisions where further simplification, rationalisation or decriminalisation is possible and we are intending to do the same exercise at the state level by providing guidance to the states as well,  he told reporters here.  He said that there will be many more rounds of this exercise with the overall objective of promoting ease of doing business and ease of living.  The Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Bill, 2023 was passed by Rajya Sabha by a voice vote on August 2. Lok Sabha cleared the legislation on July 27.  The bill converts several fines to penalties, meaning that court prosecution is not necessary to administer punishments.  It also removes imprisonment as a punishment for many offences. All offences under the Post Office Act of 1898 are being removed.  A working group has been formed to take the initiative forward. The group comprises representatives from industry associations, business chambers, legal professionals, legal experts and officials of seven ministries.  Besides, it has representatives of the National Housing Bank (NHB), the National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and the Central Pollution Control Board.  The bill seeks to amend 183 provisions of 42 Acts administered by 19 ministries to reduce the compliance burden on individuals and businesses.  Under the bill, both imprisonment and/or fine are proposed to be removed in some provisions; imprisonment is proposed to be removed and fine retained in a few provisions; and imprisonment is proposed to be removed and fine enhanced in certain provisions.  For effective implementation, the bill proposes measures such as pragmatic revision of fines and penalties commensurate to the offence committed; establishment of adjudicating officers; establishment of appellate authorities; and periodic increase in the quantum of fines and penalties.  Some of the Acts that will be amended through the bill are the Press and Registration of Books Act, the Boilers Act, the Indian Forest Act, the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act, the Warehousing Corporations Act, the Food Corporations Act, the Patents Act, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the Food Safety and Standards Act.",

Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal, who attended the meeting, said that it was indicated in that the national e-commerce policy would be released by the government in the coming months.He also said that all the stakeholders agreed to implement and follow the policy in letter and spirit. A unanimity is arrived between all stakeholders about basic pillars of e-commerce policy and rules,  Khandelwal said.He also asked to constitute a regulatory authority to monitor and regulate e-commerce trade in India.He added that representatives from different companies, including Amazon, Flipkart, Tata CLiQ, Reliance Retail, Zomato, Swiggy and Meesho, participated in the deliberations.Senior officials from the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and the consumer affairs ministry were present at the meeting.The meeting assumes significance as the government is in the process of framing a national e-commerce policy and consumer protection rules for the sector.In June, Secretary in DPIIT Rajesh Kumar Singh said that broadly the intention is to make the policy work along with the consumer protection rules and not in conflict with each other.The policy aims to prepare strategies for providing a conducive environment for inclusive and harmonious growth of the e-commerce sector through a streamlined regulatory framework for ease of doing business, adoption of modern technologies, integration of supply chains and enhancing exports through this medium.The consumer protection rules and this policy will be separate, but they will not be in conflict with each other and in fact, they will be entirely in agreement with each other.The policy would act as an overarching framework as compared to the e-commerce rules.CAIT has time and again alleged that foreign online retailers violate norms of the FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) in commerce and the government should take action against those who are indulging in malpractices.The government permits FDI in the marketplace model of e-commerce and it is not allowed in the inventory-based model. The onus of compliance with the provisions is on the infested company and any violation of FDI regulations is covered by the penal precisions of the FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act).While the RBI administers the Act, the enforcement directorate is the authority for the implementation of FEMA and takes up investigations in cases of contravention of the law.Further, the regulatory framework for the digital/e-commerce sector is still evolving in the country. The sector is governed by the Information Technology Act, Consumer Protection Act, FDI policy on the e-commerce sector, and Competition Act.The DPIIT is also working on a national retail trade policy, which is in the process of inter-ministerial consultation.",

        "articleBody": "The government on Tuesday said it has issued mandatory quality norms for smart meters and welding rods to curb the import of sub-standard goods and boost domestic manufacturing of these products. A notification in this regard was issued by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) on July 14.  These items cannot be produced, sold/traded, imported and stocked unless they bear the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) mark, the notification stated.  Now, manufacturing, storing and sale of non-BIS certified products are prohibited as per the BIS Act, 2016.  Violation of the provision of the BIS Act can attract imprisonment of up to two years or a fine of at least Rs 2 lakh for the first offence.  In case of second and subsequent offences, the fine will increase to a minimum of Rs 5 lakh and extend up to 10 times the value of goods or articles.   These recently notified two new QCOs for smart meters and welding rods and electrodes will come into force from six months from the date of notification,  an official statement said.  The department is focusing on establishing a quality control regime for its key products such as insulated flasks, potable water-bottles, flame-lighters, smart meters, and wielding rods.  QCO is a mandatory certification scheme, whereby compliance to specified list of Indian standards applicable to the concerned product is made compulsory by the central government under various considerations including public interest, protection of human, animal or plant health, safety of environment, prevention of unfair trade practices and national security.   DPIIT in continuous consultation with BIS and stakeholders has been identifying key products for requiring implementation of QCO. This has led to the initiation of development of 64 new QCOs covering 317 product standards,  it said.  Smart meter is an electronic device that records information such as consumption of electric energy, voltage levels, current and power factor.  It communicates the information to the consumer for greater clarity of consumption behaviour and electricity suppliers for system monitoring and customer billing.  Further, it said that to safeguard the domestic small/micro industries and ensure smooth implementation of the order, relaxations have been granted to small/micro industries in terms of timelines.   The implementation of the QCOs for these products is crucial not only for safety of the consumers, but it will also improve the manufacturing quality standards in the country and curb the imports of sub-standard products into India,  the DPIIT said.",

An inter-ministerial meeting on logistics was held to review the progress of implementation of the national logistics policy, the statement said adding that it was convened by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). During the meeting measures taken by different ministries to improve logistics efficiency in the country were also showcased, the commerce and industry ministry said.  A draft coal logistic policy and national coal evacuation plan has been developed by the ministry of coal. In addition, standardization of physical assets (heavy earth moving machines for coal handling) and setting up benchmarks for quality management, is under progress,  the statement said. Speaking at the meeting DPIIT Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh talked about the critical role played by ports in making India a globally competitive export destination and suggested greater adoption of initiatives like the Logistics Data Bank to draw learnings for improving logistics performance across various metrics. In the meeting, it was highlighted that for making India's domestically manufactured goods globally competitive and for achieving the USD 2.5 trillion EXIM (export-import) target by 2030, it is imperative to have an efficient logistics ecosystem. To bring holistic focus on logistics in public policy at state level, States/UTs are developing State Logistics Plans (SLPs). So far, 21 states have notified their respective logistics policies. The DPIIT also said that it has initiated an endeavour to estimate logistics cost, since no official estimates are available and they vary from 8-14 per cent of GDP.  Hence a need was felt for developing accurate estimates based on holistic data and relevant statistical models. For this, a survey-based logistics cost calculation framework is being developed and a short-term baseline estimate for logistics cost is soon to be unveiled,  it added. For tracking and tracing 100 per cent of India's containerized EXIM cargo, the Logistics Data Bank (LDB), has been developed. This supply chain visibility platform has contributed to reducing India's average dwell time to just 2.6 days and improved logistics efficiency.  For improving India's ranking in LPI and achieving the NLP target of top 25 nations in the world, all stakeholder ministries were requested to set up a dedicated cell for undertaking a strategic approach to improving performance across all six parameters of the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) and the overall ranking, thereof,  it added. Officials from CBIC highlighted measures taken for promoting trade facilitation at ports. Efforts are being made towards establishing an integrated laboratory network, promoting risk management systems for consignment screening, standardisation of processes across ports for examination of cargo, among others, are in place, it said.",

At present, the government is going by certain estimates, which suggest that India's logistics cost stands at about 13-14 per cent of the country's GDP (gross domestic product).  Special Secretary in the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Sumita Dawra said that the government is coming out with its logistics cost framework.  The framework would include elements of this cost and how to measure that.   So our framework is being done with the help of our technical partner and it's almost done. But then we have to calculate and I think by the month of September, we will have realistic logistics costs in the country. We will define what are the components and we will have our own estimates,  she said while speaking at CII's conclave on trade facilitation.  Logistics cost plays a key role in facilitating trade and enhancing the competitiveness of traders.  The department conducted a workshop in March on the logistics cost framework, and a task force was set up to formulate a framework to determine the cost in the country.  The task force members include representatives from Niti Aayog, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), academic experts, and other stakeholders.  The government has rolled out a national logistics policy and PM Gati Shakti initiative to boost the competitiveness of the industry and cut logistics costs.  Speaking at the conclave, Sanjay Budhia, Chairman of CII National Committee on EXIM and Managing Director of Patton Group, said that continued focus on creating a paperless trading ecosystem by measures like faceless assessment, risk management system, and direct port delivery have started showing results at the ground level.",

        "articleBody": "Concerned departments where the production-linked incentive scheme is not picking up may consider some course correction in the plan, a top government official said on Tuesday. Secretary in the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Rajesh Kumar Singh said the concerned ministries have to see if PLI disbursement is low or if firms are not able to meet their performance thresholds, in such cases, sometime relaxations may be required like the way it has been done for the IT sector. Last month, the government announced the PLI 2.0 for IT Hardware with a budgetary outlay of Rs 17,000 crore.  We are hopeful of utilising Rs 1.97 lakh crore for the scheme...but in an individual scheme, there may be some course correction,  Singh told reporters here. The government has announced the PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme for as many as 14 sectors, such as telecommunication, white goods, textiles and pharma with an outlay of Rs 1.97 lakh crore. The government has disbursed only Rs 2,900 crore till March 2023, out of Rs 3,400 crore claims received. When asked about the reason for low disbursals, Additional Secretary in the DPIIT Rajeev Singh Thakur said that the next two years would be crucial.  In eight sectors, we are disbursing the incentives and in the remaining six, we are hopeful (to start the disbursements). This year and next year, we will be on track,  Thakur said. On this, the secretary added that they are  not too  concerned about the lag in the incentives as investments are happening.  We expect the disbursement to pick up...Projects are on the ground, and investments and employment are happening. The disbursement will follow...But yes, there is a lag,  the secretary said. The eight sectors where PLI performance is healthy include large-scale electronics manufacturing, pharma, food processing, telecom, white goods, auto and auto components. Sectors which are not picking up well include high-efficiency solar PV modules, advanced chemistry cell (ACC) batteries, textile products and speciality steel. Further, the secretary said that proposals for extending fiscal benefits under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for toys, leather and footwear and components for new-age bicycles are in advanced stages. Singh said they all are at different stages of consideration.  Few of them are in the advanced stages like toy, leather and footwear, components for new age bicycles,  he told reporters here. In these 14 sectors, the government has received 733 applications as of March this year. In these sectors, 3.25 lakh jobs have been generated and goods worth Rs 2.6 lakh crore have been exported till 2022-23. He also pointed out that Apple and its vendors are coming to India and  we want to follow  the success of this sector in other segments also. Thakur said that in electronics and mobile manufacturing, value addition has been increased to 23 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively. It was negligible in 2014-15. In China, the value addition is about 49 per cent and 18 per cent in Vietnam. According to the department, mobile phones export from India has increased to Rs 90,000 crore during April-December 2022-23 against Rs 45,000 crore in 2021-22. Out of the total mobile phone exports during 2022-23, 82 per cent were by the PLI companies. iPhone 14 exports from India would touch USD 10 billion in 2024-25, according to a presentation by the department. The additional secretary also informed that the government is getting a good amount as tax due to these investments.  Our guess is that , the government would have collected about Rs 5 lakh crore as taxes and duties, Thakur said.",

        "articleBody": "The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is hand-holding states and central government sellers like handicraft emporiums to gradually integrate with Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), a senior official said on Monday. ONDC is an initiative of the DPIIT to create a facilitative model to help small retailers take advantage of digital commerce. It is not an application, platform, intermediary or software but a set of specifications designed to foster open, unbundled, and interoperable open networks. Joint Secretary in the DPIIT Sanjiv said that supporting MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) has been a priority for the ONDC.  This will unlock value in the huge B2B (business-to-business) market by increasing access and discoverability of various businesses across the network.  As we look forward to the integration of credit in the ONDC, the business can hugely benefit from the open network ecosystem by being a part of the ONDC,  he said here at a function - 'B2B Unlocked'. The initiative assumes significance when it comes to digital commerce, that is, end-to-end transactions, from discovery to purchase, only a handful of Indian businesses are adopting digital. As per estimates, less than 2 per cent of Indian businesses use digital tools to make themselves or their products visible digitally. He said that ONDC has made significant strides in the last few months as sellers and service providers on the network have increased to more than one lakh and the network participants have increased to 51.  There was a significant increase in the number of orders per day in the past month and as the network continues to stabilise, there will be an increase in the transaction volume,  Sanjiv said. The event marked the official entry of the open network into the realm of B2B trade, enabling merchants to engage directly with other businesses in wholesale trade. SignCatch and Rapidor have enabled both the B2B buyer and seller side platforms on ONDC, fostering seamless interoperability between sellers and buyers. This implementation allows sellers to utilise SignCatch to receive orders from Rapidor B2B buyer platform and vice versa. Incorporated on December 31, 2021, ONDC is a Section 8 company.",

        "articleBody": "An inter-ministerial consultation is going on for formulation of a new industrial policy, which would aim at building a globally competitive business environment to increase manufacturing and exports, a top government official has said. This would be the third industrial policy after the first in 1956 and the second in 1991.  It is likely to replace the industrial policy of 1991 which was prepared against the backdrop of the balance of payment crisis.   The policy is in the process of inter-ministerial consultation...It will focus on newer set of industries that has now come,  Secretary in Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Rajesh Kumar Singh told PTI.  The proposed policy is likely to suggest reforms to foster and create a globally progressive, innovative and competitive industrial ecosystem.  The six core objectives of the policy may include focus on competitiveness and capability; economic integration and moving up the global value chain; promoting India as an attractive investment destination in the world; nurturing innovation and entrepreneurship; and circular and sustainable ecosystem.  After the completion of the consultations, the department is likely to approach the Union Cabinet for its approval.  When asked about the progress on revising Wholesale Price Index (WPI) base year from 2011-12 to 2017-18, Singh said it is also in the process of inter-ministerial consultation.  Revising the base year would help in presenting a more realistic picture of the price situation in the country.  The department in June 2021 had issued a draft technical report of a working group, which suggested revising the base year and addition of about 480 items such as medicinal plants, pen drive, lifts, gymnasium equipment, and certain motorcycle engines in the new series.  At present, the index has a total of 697 items, including primary articles (117), fuel and power (16) and manufactured products (564).  WPI revision is a periodic exercise. The current revision process of WPI base year has been undertaken to incorporate the structural changes in the economy.  Two major indices are used for tracking price movement -- Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI).  While WPI measures price movement of goods in wholesale markets, the CPI tracks inflation at the retail level and also includes certain services.  Ever since the introduction of WPI in 1942 with base year 1939, seven revisions have taken place introducing new base years - 1952-53, 1961-62, 1970-71, 1981-82, 1993-94, 2004-05 and 2011-12.  The current WPI base year 2011-12 series was launched in May 2017.",

It may be noted that advertisements of gambling/betting platforms not only pose significant financial and socio-economic risk for consumers, especially the youth and children, but have linkages to money laundering networks, thereby threatening the financial security of the country,  the advisory said.The ministry had issued similar advisories at least on three earlier occasions - in June and October last year and in April this year. These advisories have stated that betting and gambling was an illegal activity and hence advertisements/promotion of such activities directly or indirectly on any of the media platforms falls foul of the various statutes, including under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the Press Council Act 1978, etc,  according to an official statement.",

The report, presented to the parliamentary standing committee on social justice and empowerment, showed that of the 20 departments entrusted with formulating sector-specific accessibility guidelines, only nine have done so.

        "articleBody": "New Delhi, Eleven ministries are yet to finalise their sector-specific accessibility guidelines for people with disabilities, the government said on Thursday. The information was shared by the Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry with the parliamentary standing committee on social justice and empowerment. The parliamentary panel report was tabled in Lok Sabha on Thursday.  The ministry said the departments of Law and Justice, Consumer Affairs and Telecommunication are following the guidelines of MEITY and MoHUA respective to their domain related to people with disabilities.   Other than this, five Ministries namely MoHUA, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Department of Sports have notified their guidelines in the official gazette and are currently underway of draft and final notification in The Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016 Rules,  the ministry told the parliamentary panel.  The ministry said that the  remaining eleven ministries are at various stages of finalisation of their respective sector-specific accessibility guidelines .  The Committee, in response, said it finds that while progress has been made in terms of framing Accessible India Campaign (AIC) specific guidelines, training, etc, yet the objectives of the scheme are far from being realised.   For instance, so far out of the 20 ministries/departments entrusted with the task of formulation of Sector Specific Standards of Accessibility, only nine ministries have done it so far and 11 are yet to finalise their guidelines,  the panel said.  The Committee said it would like to stress the fact that AIC seeks to build a truly inclusive and barrier-free environment for People with Disabilities (PwDs) and hence such a lackadaisical attitude of some of the government agencies is  very disheartening .  It urged the department to accord utmost priority to removing any impediments in the successful implementation of the scheme and to continuously remind the remaining departments to finalise their guidelines expeditiously in coordination with the Ministries/states/UTs so as to enable the PwDs to avail the intended benefits seamlessly  Also, the Committee, chaired by MP Rama Devi, said that it has recommended a proactive approach for the exemption of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on aids and appliances for PwDs as such an action would make aids and appliances more affordable.   The Committee is of the opinion that aids and appliances are essential items for persons with disabilities for their daily mobility to gain access to the opportunities of education, employment or enjoyment of other rights or the discharge of duties as responsible citizens,  it said.   Hence, the committee would like to reiterate their earlier recommendation and urge the Department to continue with sustained efforts to prioritise the removal of GST on aids and appliances, as without them many PwDs would be forced into living a restricted and confined life or in a state of seclusion,  the panel said.",

        "description": "With the 2024 Paris Olympics a year away, sports governing bodies are divided on how to treat Russian athletes. Some sports have lifted bans on Russian athletes and are allowing them to compete as neutral competitors without a flag or national anthem. Most of the sports that allow Russians to compete follow the IOC's advice and prefer to call them  individual neutral athletes.  ",
        "datePublished": "2023-07-24T21:17:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "A year before the Paris Olympics, and nearly a year-and-a-half since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, officials governing many of the sports on the 2024 program are still split on how to treat Russian athletes. Increasingly, various governing bodies are allowing them back into Olympic qualifying competitions as neutral competitors without national flags or anthems. Most sports initially barred Russians from competing soon after last year's full-scale invasion. The International Olympic Committee strongly backs those moves even as the body itself says it hasn't decided if athletes from Russia and ally Belarus can compete at the Paris Games. However, the IOC has delayed action on the one sport whose qualification it runs in-house, boxing. Most of the sports which have allowed Russians to return also followed IOC advice on its preferred name -  individual neutral athletes  - and to keep barring those who are under contract with the military or who have supported the war publicly. The IOC also recommends blocking Russia from team sports like soccer or basketball. Ukraine is opposed to any Russians competing. Since last year, Ukrainian athletes and national teams have been boycotting competitions which allow Russians back in, a policy enforced in April by a government decree. Activists from Ukraine have been trawling Russian athletes' social media for pro-war posts that could disqualify them from competing. Here is a look at the situation for Russian and Ukrainian athletes in key sports on the Olympic program: Track and Field World Athletics excluded athletes from Russia and Belarus from competitions after the invasion of Ukraine. That remains in place  for the foreseeable future,  after a vote of the World Athletics council in March. President Sebastian Coe said at the time that deaths and destruction in Ukraine have only  hardened  his resolve to keep a ban in place. Swimming World Aquatics is one of the sports taking Russia's return slowly. It has said it favors Russia and Belarus returning to its sports - swimming, diving, water polo, artistic swimming - but set up a task force that won't report back with suggestions until late July. That means no Russians at the world championships this month in Japan. Tennis The big exception among Olympic sports in tennis. The men's and women's tours didn't exclude Russian or Belarusian players when Russia launched its invasion. They even fined tournaments including Wimbledon which did impose restrictions. Ukrainian players continued competing but often refuse to shake hands with Russians or Belarusians. Aryna Sabalenka, who is from Belarus and won the Australian Open in January, has been questioned about her past support for Belarus' authoritarian leader, President Alexander Lukashenko. She has said she does not support the war. Russian and Belarusian players still can't enter national team competitions like the Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup. The International Tennis Federation hasn't made a final decision on the Olympics but has plenty of time because qualification is decided by the June 2024 world rankings. Gymnastics Gymnasts from Russia and Belarus will be allowed to take part in sanctioned competitions as  individual neutral athletes  from the start of 2024. That timetable pushed their return beyond the world championships in early October in Belgium. Russian gymnasts have been some of the most vocal supporters of the war. Days after the invasion, Ivan Kuliak wore a pro-war  Z  symbol on a competition podium while standing next to a Ukrainian athlete. He was suspended for a year. Other Russian gymnasts appeared on stage at a rally in support of the war, and Olympic gold medalist Nikita Nagornyy heads a military youth organization in Russia. Boxing This is the one sport the IOC has total control over, but that doesn't mean a quick decision. The IOC is running Olympic boxing in Paris and qualifiers in-house after a long-running feud with the International Boxing Association and its Russian president. Qualifiers were held at the European Games in June but the host nation, Poland, refused to allow any Russian athletes. A plan to qualify Russians via the Asian Games has been suggested but not confirmed. That could mean any Russian return only happens at two last-chance qualifying tournaments in early 2024. Combat Sports Sports like fencing, judo and taekwondo have seen some of the bitterest disputes. Ukraine boycotted the world championships in both judo and taekwondo, taking a big hit to its Olympic qualifying hopes, after Russians were allowed to compete. In judo the  neutral  delegation of Russian athletes included some previously listed by the Defense Ministry as holding military ranks. The International Judo Federation, which had last year opposed excluding any Russians, said all the Russian competitors were employed at a state sports training facility.  Ukraine is also boycotting some events at the fencing world championships in Italy, another key Olympic qualifier. The International Fencing Federation - whose former president, Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, said last year he was stepping aside from his duties - has been a strong supporter of reintroducing Russian and Belarusian fencers this year. Competition organizers in several European countries canceled their events in protests, disrupting the Olympic qualifying calendar, and the European Championships were stripped of their status as a qualifier when Poland refused to allow Russians to compete. Team Sports Don't expect to see Russian teams competing in soccer, volleyball, basketball or handball at the Paris Olympics. The IOC still backs excluding Russia from team sports and no Olympic sport has yet defied that regulation. In some events, like men's basketball and soccer, Russia has already missed its last chance to qualify. The IOC also recommends a ban on  team events in individual sports  like relay races or the team all-around in gymnastics. Other Sports Russia is boycotting weightlifting events after its team refused to sign a waiver accepting the conditions for  neutral  status, including a promise to  continue to abstain from expressing any support to the war.  Belarusian athletes signed and are competing. Some sports like archery have delayed things further. World Archery is exploring plans for a Russian return but said in February it would be  very unlikely  this year, potentially restricting Russia to a limited number of events in the months just before the Olympics. Canoeing is planning to allow Russians back in some Olympic qualifiers but is giving the local organizers of each competition a veto. Rowing will only allow single sculls and pairs, no larger Russian crews.",

        "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: In an ugly war of words, Sakshi Malik accused former wrestler and BJP leader Babita Phogat of siding with the government during their protest against the WFI chief while the latter claimed that the Rio Games bronze medallist has become a  Congress' puppet .Malik and her husband Satyawart Kadian had on Saturday asserted that the wrestlers' protest was not politically motivated and in no way it was inspired by Congress as it was BJP leaders Babita and Teerath Rana, who had helped them in taking police permission for the sit-in at Jantar Mantar.On Sunday, quoting their Saturday video, Malik tweeted that they had taken a dig at Babita and Rana about how they tried to use the wrestlers for their selfish motives but the satire was not understood for the lack of sense of humour. In the video (posted on Saturday), we had commented how Teerath Rana and Babita Phogat were trying to use wrestlers for their selfish motives and how when the wrestlers were in trouble, they opted to sit on the lap of the government.  We are definitely in trouble, but the sense of humour should not become so weak that a joke cracked on the powerful could not be understood,  the tweet read further.Babita, who had mediated between the wrestlers and the government during the grapplers' three-day protest in January, tweeted a long reply to Malik and claimed that she had nothing to do with their protest since she was against the agitation on road from day one. It pained me and also made me laugh when I saw the video posted by my younger sister and her husband. Let me make it clear that the letter, seeking police permission, does not carry my signature. I have nothing to do with that,  she wrote, completely pulling herself away from the protest. From day one, I was not in favour of any protest or demonstration. I had maintained that I have faith in the PM and the judiciary and the truth will come out. I repeatedly told them to meet Prime Minister or Home Minister for a solution but you saw solution with Deepnder Hooda, Congress and Priyanka Gandhi, who themselves were accompanied by rape accused people. .......your video will make people understand that how shameful it was on your part to start a march on the inauguration day of the new parliament building and then talking about immersing medals in river Ganga. People of this country have understood that you have become a Congress' puppet. Now is the time that you reveal your real motive because people are asking questions now,  wrote Babita.Meanwhile, Rana denied the allegations that he had used the wrestlers for selfish motives. The wrestlers came and met me (before staging the protest) and they told us that they were being exploited. We said we are with our sisters and daughters. I am with the athletes in the fight for justice. I was there with them before and I am now as well,  Rana said in a video.The video was shared in the WhatsApp group that was created to disseminate information to media during protest. The Rana video was later deleted from the group. Look, wrestlers are the pride of the nation and the respect of sportspersons is uppermost on the mind of the BJP, and I also respect them a lot. I have always supported sportspersons,  said Rana in the video.The country's top wrestlers including Malik, Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia have accused outgoing Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh of sexual harassment and demanded his arrest.Kadian had claimed in their saturday video that if they had taken the extreme step of immersing their medals in Ganga, it would have led to violence.Responding to that, Rana said,  Well, there was no such talk that it (immersion of medals) would lead to violence. There was anger among the sportspersons and they took a decision that they would immerse their medals in river Ganga...but the country's sentiments were that the athletes should not take such a step.

The announcement comes a day after the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) appointed retired high court judge Mahesh Mittal Kumar as the returning officer to set the poll process in motion.  It was also notified that the results of the elections will also be announced on same day.  The last date for receiving two nominations from each state and union territory for constituting the electoral college has been fixed as June 19 and the scrutiny will be completed by June 22.  Each state unit can send two representatives and each representative shall have one vote. So, the electoral college for the WFI elections will consist of 50 votes. But it is learnt that a few state bodies, dissolved by the WFI in the past, have also staked their claim to participate in the elections.  The returning office after going through the credentials of the representatives of the factions will decide who can vote and who cannot.  The submission of nominations for elections will commence on June 23 and conclude on June 25, which will be followed by preparation and display of the nominations, while the scrutiny of the nomination papers will take place on June 28.  The candidates will be able to withdraw their nominations between June 28 and July 1, following which the final list of contesting candidates will be put up on July 2.  In his notification issued on Tuesday, the returning office wrote,  Whereas, the last date of receiving two nominations from each State/UT for constituting the electoral college has been fixed as 5.00 p.m of 19th June,2023, all the recognised Wrestling Federations of the states/UTs under the ratified constitution of the W.F.I and the guidelines of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, Govt. of India are hereby called upon to nominate two (2) persons each of the respective associations who are the members of executive body of such State/UT Units, for the purpose of constituting the electoral college for the ensuing general election to elect members of the Executing Committee.   The nominations must be sent... under the signature and seal of the respective Federations by the President and the General Secretary, but not later than 5.00 p.m. of the 19.6.2023.   The WFI elections will be held for the post of president, senior vice-president, four vice-presidents, secretary-general, treasurer, two joint secretaries, and five executive members.  It was widely speculated that the elections would take place on July 4 after the IOA appointed Mittal, the former Jammu and Kashmir High Court Chief Justice, as the returning officer on Monday.  The main task before the retired judge would be to decide which rival faction within the state bodies will participate in the polls, as two different state bodies in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Karnataka have reportedly sent names for inclusion in the voters list for the elections.  WFI had dissolved Karnataka, Haryana and Maharashtra at its Executive Committee meeting in June 2022 for various reasons, including  corruption and mismanagement .  Another big issue in the elections is whether family member or associates of outgoing WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh will be allowed to contest elections.  Sports Minister Anurag Thakur had assured the wresters that the government will not allow any of the Brij Bhushan's relative to contest the polls.  It remains to be seen what happens if the eligible candidates associated with Brij Bhushan file their nomination for the elections.  Brij Bhushan's son Karan was vice-president in the previous WFI setup and is also associated with the UP wrestling association. His son-in-law Vishal Singh is the president of the Bihar Wrestling Association.  They are both eligible to contest as state body representatives.",

The pension adalat initiative was started on experimental basis in 2017 by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare. In 2018, national pension adalat was held by leveraging technology for speedy resolution of pensioners' grievance. The model adopted is that all stakeholders to a particular grievance are invited on a common platform and the case is resolved according to every stakeholder to complete the pension processing so that pension is started on time, the statement added.",

It's normal procedure. When the oversight committee was formed, then also we had given them all the necessary filed through our staff. Now this ad hoc panel is there and we can give them whatever documents they need to manage WFI,  Prasood told PTI. It's not an issue. Our term is already over and the IOA and the government is managing, it's normal procedure to ask for these documents.

The decision that has been taken in this fight for justice, that if something is not done by May 21, if our demands (to arrest Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh) are not met during that period then we will have to take a big call,  said Vinesh to the media.Vinesh said that their demand to get Brij Bhushan Singh arrested.On their future in wrestling amid protests, Vinesh said,  We will compete. If God presents an opportunity before us then we will definitely play. We are still trying to train as much as possible during the protests, trying to find time for it and plan our training schedule,  said Vinesh.Ahead of the farmers' march coming from various states in support of the protesting wrestlers in the national capital, security has been beefed up at the Delhi-Ghazipur border on Sunday.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha had announced holding nationwide protests including in Delhi in support of the wrestlers.According to an SKM statement on Saturday, on May 7, several leaders of the organisation from Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh will visit the protest site at Jantar Mantar and extend support to the protesting wrestlers.Speaking on the allegation against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, farmer leader Joginder Singh, at the Tikri border, said,  They are in power and it is very difficult to stand against a person who is misusing his power and position for so long, but we will fight against it.  Government's job is to stop us but we will go to the place where we want to go. If they try to stop us, it will cost them. There are no plans of staying here, if government and administration stop us, then we'll have to stay here,  he told ANI.Notably, SKM had spearheaded the year-long farmers' protest on the borders of the national capital against the now-repealed farm laws.On April 23, Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Malik returned to the protest site at Jantar Mantar, claiming that six women wrestlers, and a minor, filed a sexual harassment complaint against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh at Connaught Place Police Station but Delhi Police did not register an FIR. The protesting grapplers also demanded that the Sports Ministry make the findings of the Oversight Committee public.Delhi Police filed two FIRs on April 28 following the notice by the Supreme Court.Earlier this year, prominent wrestlers came forward to lead a protest against the WFI chief, following which the Union Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports announced the formation of an 'oversight committee' to probe allegations against the WFI, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and some coaches.The protesting wrestlers have made it clear that they won't move until they get justice and Brij Bhushan is removed as the WFI chief and put behind bars.",

        "description": "Indian wrestlers have appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over sexual harassment allegations against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, an MP and Wrestling Federation of India chief. The athletes said Modi had previously welcomed and celebrated their successes but had now ignored their plight. The Sports Ministry has not disclosed the findings of a six-member committee that investigated the allegations. ",

        "articleBody": " Why are you not listening to our 'Mann Ki Baat',  the protesting wrestlers asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday and sought his time to discuss the sexual harassment allegations against his party's MP and WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. Country's top wrestlers resumed their agitation against the wrestling federation's chief on Sunday, three months after they ended their sit-in protest following the formation of an oversight committee to probe into the serious allegations.  The Sports Ministry has not yet made public the findings of six-member oversight panel that submitted its report on April 5.  The wresters on Wednesday said they are surprised that PM Modi felicitates them and clicks pictures with them when they win medals but now he has turned a blind eye to their plight when they are on road, seeking justice.   PM Modi sir talks about 'Beti Bachao' and 'Beti Padhao', and listens to everyone's 'Mann Ki Baat'. Can't he listen to our 'mann ki baat'? He invites us to his home when we win medals and gives us a lot of respect and calls us his daughters. Today, we appeal to him that he listens to our 'Mann Ki Baat',  Rio Games bronze medallist Sakshi Malik said during a media interaction.  Interestingly, Malik drew analogy with Prime Minister's popular radio programme 'Mann Ki Baat' which is completing 100 editions and to mark the milestone, several programs are being organised by the government.   I want to ask Smriti Irani (Union Minister) why is she silent now? It's been four days that we are sleeping on road, enduring mosquito bites. We are not being allowed (by Delhi Police) to prepare food and train, why are you silent? I just want to say that you come here, listen to us and support us,  added Malik.  Malik feels may be their point is not reaching the Prime Minister.   Maybe our truth is not reaching him, so we want to meet him and let him know our issues.   An emotional World championship medallist Vinesh Phogat said, we don't have the (telephone) numbers (of relevant people) by which we can reach out to him so we are appealing to PM Modi through media to raise issues. Maybe he can then listen to your cries. Our souls are almost dead, maybe he will see.    He does his program 'Mann ki Baat' but has he, even for a minute given a thought to our 'mann ki baat, how much dilemma, does he think we face that daughters of the nation are sitting on the roads and are on the cusp of quitting wrestling by standing against a big criminal?   Vinesh also said that they will take out a candle light march later in the evening.   Maybe the authorities can't see, so we will take out a candle light march to offer some light. Maybe they can see that daughters of India, who are not just wrestlers but represent the feelings of many women, are out on the roads.  Tokyo Games bronze medallist Bajrang also appealed to the PM.   These are daughters of India appealing to you, please do justice with them,  he said.  We had brought wrestling mats for practice but we were not allowed, even we can't prepare our food here because there is no permission. Now, will we have to take permission even for breathing,  asked Bajrang.  He also added that efforts are being made by WFI chief's men to scare them.   A few people are trying to discourage us and scare us by narrating stories how Brij Bhushan got an adversary killed. But let me tell you that we are not going to get scared.   Vinesh also appealed to all athletes, across disciplines, to stand united with them.   Can't we put behind greed, fear and self interest behind? I appeal to all sports persons of the nation, Olympic medallists, national medallists and world championship medallists to come together and stay united.   If we come together, there is no reason why we can't be number one nation in Olympics one day. ",

        "articleBody": "India's top wrestlers resumed their protest against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over the allegations of sexual harassment at the Jantar Mantar in the national capital on Sunday.  Wrestlers protest unjustified. They were heard by the minister and the Ministry. The Minister sat with them in a meeting for over 12 hours. On their demand, a committee was formed. They further asked for the addition of another name that too was done! They cannot be protesting till the entire report is examined,  said a top government source. Sources said WFI wanted to hold its election, but it will not be allowed by the government till the Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh matter is sorted out. Till the matter is sorted out, the government will ask the Indian Olympic Association to look after the day-to-day matters of the association.  On their front, the government is putting a hold on the Wrestling Federation election. The government will ask Indian Olympic Association or set up a Committee of Administrators to run the matter till then,  said the source. The source further said,  The wrestlers are demanding that Anurag Thakur should have met them, but since the enquiry is ongoing and that the enquiry was set up by the Sports Ministry under Thakur. It would be unfair to meet the wrestlers at this stage. But the government, especially the Sports Minister has constantly engaged with the wrestlers. Earlier, the Minister gave them a hearing for over 13 hours before announcing the committee.  According to sources, Sports Minister Anurag Thakur had dropped his programme in Himachal Pradesh to join a meeting with protesting wrestlers. The wrestlers did not turn around in the morning but came late in the evening. Even then also Anurag Thakur cancelled all his appointments and waited for them and then the committee was announced. The committee was announced as per the demand of the wrestlers, and when they asked for an additional member, even that was honoured by the government,  added the source. Having waited for three months, star wrestlers like Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia again started their protest against WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh on Sunday and said that they took the step after alleging that no action has been taken in the matter and said that the FIR has not been registered against the WFI chief.Ace India wrestler Sakshi Malik broke down while interacting with the media as wrestlers protest at Jantar Mantar. We wanted to file a sexual harassment FIR against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. We got a complaint filed two days ago but FIR has not been registered yet. There are seven female wrestlers and one of them is a minor. We want the investigation to happen fast. It is a sensitive matter. We are being framed as liars which we cannot bear. We are waiting for two and a half months now but no one is listening. People are saying we are spent force that is why we are protesting. We just won a medal at CWG 2022,  Sakshi Malik told the media at Jantar Mantar.  It is being heard that we are finished, that is why we are protesting. For two and a half months the government has not taken any action. We cannot reveal the name of a minor. Otherwise, her name and career will get spoilt,  she added.Earlier in January this year, top Indian wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat, Ravi Dahiya and Sakshi Malik, held a sit-in protest in Jantar Mantar, demanding that Brij Bhushan be removed from the head office and Wrestling Federation of India be disbanded. They had accused the body and its chief of sexual harassment and mistreatment of wrestlers.Following the protest, in January, the Union Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports announced the formation of an 'oversight committee' to probe allegations levelled against the Wrestling Federation of India and its chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and other coaches. The committee was given the task of submitting a report on the issue to the Ministry.Olympic medalist Mary Kom is heading the Oversight Committee. Former wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, former shuttler Trupti Murgunde, SAI member Radhica Sreeman, former CEO of the Target Olympic Podium Plan Rajesh Rajagopalan and CWG gold medalist Babita Phogat are the other members of the Mary Kom-led committee.But in April, Punia had said that the wrestlers would go to court to protest against the report of the oversight committee appointed to investigate the matter and allegations put up by prominent Indian wrestlers against the WFI and its president Brijbhushan Sharan Singh.Speaking to ANI, Punia said,  I read an article in which one of the committee members said that the report has been submitted to the Sports ministry without his signatures. The member also expressed his/her disagreement with the report. If a committee member is not involved in report submission and disagrees with the report, how are we supposed to trust it?  We were not even informed that the report was submitted to the ministry,  he added.Punia also said that WFI should make public the statements given by female wrestlers in a sting operation to a private TV channel if it feels it is innocent and also, people get to decide who is right or wrong.The wrestler said that they (wrestlers) will start protesting once again and will even go to the high court as soon as possible. We have to carry on with our sport, but we will protest and go to the high court as soon as possible,  said Punia. ",

The amount is more than the revised budget of the previous financial year (2022-23) when the ministry received Rs 2,673.35 crore, as against the actual allocation of Rs 3,062.60 crore.  One of the reasons for the reduced revised allocation for 2022-23 could be the postponement of the Hangzhou Asian Games, which will be held this year.  The ministry's flagship programme, 'Khelo India -- National Programme for Development of Sports' continues to be the government's priority, with it being allotted Rs 1,045 crore as against the revised allocation of Rs 606 crore during the previous financial year.  This is an increase of Rs 439 crore and points to the government's commitment to the programme, which over the years, has shown the potential to produce athletes for major global events such as the Olympics, Asian Games and the Commonwealth Games.  The Sports Authority of India (SAI), which takes care of organising national camps for athletes, providing infrastructure and equipment to athletes, appointment of coaches and maintaining sports infrastructure, among others, has seen a Rs 36.09 crore increase in its budgetary allocation from the previous year's revised expenditure of Rs 749.43 crore. Their allocation for 2023-24 stands at Rs 785.52 crore.  The National Sports Federations (NSFs) have received an increased allocation of Rs 45 crore, from previous year's revised budget of Rs 280 crore and will now get Rs 325 crore.  The National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA), affiliated to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), and the National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL), which earlier received funding from SAI, will now get it directly.  A provision has been made in this year's budget to provide NADA a funding of Rs 21.73 crore, while NDTL, which conducts the tests, will receive Rs 19.50 crore.  With countries across the world striving for sporting excellence and paying more attention to sports science and scientific training of athletes, this year's budget has also made a provision of Rs 13 crore for National Centre of Sports Science and Research.",

Sports Minister Anurag Thakur had earlier this month announced the formation of the committee to investigate the charges against the WFI chief and also manage the day-to-day affairs of the sports body.

        "articleBody": "The government is unhappy with the wrestlers' behaviour and will not reconstitute the oversight committee formed to probe the sexual harassment charges against WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, Sports Ministry sources said on Wednesday. Sports Minister Anurag Thakur had on Monday announced that a five-member oversight committee, headed by legendary boxer M C Mary Kom, will investigate the charges against the Wrestling Federation of India boss and also manage the day-to-day affairs of the sports body.  Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat, Sarita Mor and Sakshi Malik, who staged a sit-in protest at Jantar Mantar for three days demanding the sacking of the WFI president, expressed disappointment that they were not consulted before the formation of the committee.   The ministry has no plans to reconstitute the oversight committee to probe the allegations against WFI chief Brij Bhushan Singh,  a ministry source told PTI on Wednesday.   We have formed a fair committee under Mary Kom which will go into the details of the matter,  said the source, adding that the government is unhappy with the wrestlers' behaviour as they went public with their reservations on the formation of the committee.97348745  According to sources, the protesting wrestlers consider the London Olympics bronze medallist Yogeshwar close to the WFI president. In fact, when Yogeshwar backed the under-fire Sharan, Vinesh had said that he was  sitting on WFI's lap.   The wrestlers had taken to twitter to express their dismay on Tuesday.  However on Wednesday, Bajrang clarified that the grapplers don't have an issue with Yogeshwar but they expected to be consulted before the members were finalised.   We would like to speak with the Sports Minister after the Republic Day celebrations. We don't have any problem with any members in the committee but we should have been consulted,  Bajrang Punia told PTI.  Asked if no names were discussed with them, Bajrang said,  A discussion had happened and these names came up but we were told to come back on the names after discussion.   But the names were announced before we replied in affirmative. Government should not be unhappy with us. What have we done, we are fighting for justice,  he added.  Apart from Yogeshwar, ex-badminton player and Mission Olympic Cell member Trupti Murgunde, ex-TOPS CEO Rajagopalan and former SAI executive director - teams - Radhica Sreeman are also member of the committee.  Both May Kom and Yogeshwar are also part of the the seven-member committee formed by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to probe the allegations of sexual harassment and corruption against the WFI chief.  Besides legendary boxer Mary Kom and wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, the IOA panel includes archer Dola Banerjee and Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWLF) president and IOA treasurer Sahdev Yadav.  The other members of the IOA committee are two advocates -- Talish Ray and Shlok Chandra -- besides former shuttler and IOA joint secretary Alaknanda Ashok, who is its vice chairperson.  The agitating wrestlers, including young Anshu Malik, Sangeeta Phogat and Sonam Malik among others, started the sit-in protest at Jantar Mantar here on Wednesday and demanded the sacking of the WFI chief.  The wrestlers had accused Sharan, who is also a BJP MP, of acting like a dictator and sexually harassing junior wrestlers.  The wrestlers did not reveal the identity of the athletes who faced sexual harassment.",

        "articleBody": "The Union sports ministry has asked the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) to suspend its activities, including its general body meeting scheduled for Sunday in Ayodhya, till an oversight committee takes charge of the body.This came a day after the government set up the oversight panel to examine allegations of sexual abuse and financial irregularities against WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh that were brought to light by prominent sportspersons recently.Singh who had earlier said that the emergency general body meeting of around 80 members will take up all issues raised by sportspersons, tweeted on Sunday evening that he was not  larger than the party.  He said his commitment to the BJP was unquestionable and asked his followers to not vent their anger on social media by posting objectionable content.The sports ministry also issued instructions to suspend WFI\u2019s assistant secretary, Vinod Tomar, who had openly backed Singh and accused the protesting wrestlers of a \u201chidden agenda\u201d.The government said Tomar\u2019s \u201ccontinued presence will be detrimental\u201d to the working of the oversight body. The ministry has yet to announce the names of the committee members.Many prominent wrestlers including Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Ravi Dahiya have accused Singh of harassment and intimidation. Singh has been heading the WFI for ten years now.The sports ministry on Saturday had directed Singh to stay away from the day-to-day affairs of the WFI.Singh was however present at a wrestling event in his bastion Gonda (in Uttar Pradesh) on the same day, a development that irked wrestlers who had called off their protest a few hours after talks with sports minister Anurag Thakur.Thakur said on Sunday that the ranking tournament for wrestlers in Gonda had been cancelled and that the body had been asked to reimburse those participants who had paid an entry fee.The decision to form an oversight committee, seen as a breakthrough in talks between the protesters and the ministry, was taken after a marathon meeting Friday night that lasted five hours between the sports minister and wrestlers in the presence of the sports secretary and DG, Sports Authority of India, ET has learnt.Back-channel talks with the wrestlers will continue, even as the ministry finalises the names of the members of the committee, sources said.According to those in the know, handling the issue was a challenge as the federation is an independent elected body and the ministry had to quickly find a solution to reassure wrestlers who had been protesting since Wednesday.The government also wanted to avoid a repeat of the suspension of the All India Football Federation (AIFF), a matter that went to the Supreme Court before the Under-17 Women's World Cup last year.Since there was no formal complaint or police action, the sports ministry was keen to understand the exact charges against Singh so that further action could be initiated, a source said.Even as the talks started on Thursday, the ministry also sought a response from the WFI within 72 hours, while also making efforts to stall public utterances by Singh.A six-term MP and a strongman from Gonda, 66-year-old Singh had threatened that there would be a \u201ctsunami\u201d if he was asked to quit.Sources said the Centre had made it clear that with the Republic Day closing in, the protests had to end soon for the festivities to take over.A wrestler told ET that Thakur had listened to their complaints patiently and had asked them to suggest names that could be considered for the committee.The second round of conclusive talks with the wrestlers were held on Thursday after Thakur cut short his programmes in Himachal Pradesh and rushed to Delhi to address the issue.\u201cThe minister told us that even the coaches who have been complained against will be asked to step aside till the investigation is complete. That was reassuring,\u201d another source said.Meanwhile, WFI has rejected all the allegations in an eight-page response to the ministry, and instead accused the players of pushing vested interests and of conspiracy against other states that wanted to develop in sports just like Haryana.",

It has decided to suspend Tomar,  with immediate effect, to ensure proper functioning of WFI .  The ministry said it has also directed the WFI to suspend  all ongoing activities with immediate effect , including the Ranking Tournament in Gonda, UP, Sharan's stronghold.  This comes a day after Sports Minister Anurag Thakur announced the formation of an oversight committee to probe the charges levelled by some of the country's top wrestlers, including Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Ravi Dahiya, against Sharan and his body.  Regarding Tomar, the ministry said in a letter, which is in possession of the PTI, that his presence will be  detrimental to the development of this high-priority discipline .   The Ministry has taken note of the reports about the functioning of the WFI, including the role of Shri Vinod Tomar and, has the reasons to believe that his continued presence will be detrimental to the development of this high-priority discipline,  the ministry said in the letter.  The aggrieved wrestlers had alleged that Tomar took bribes from athletes and was involved in financial corruption, helping him to build property worth crores.  According to sources, the ministry will announce the names of its oversight committee members on Sunday.  In a press release, the ministry said it  has communicated to the Wrestling Federation of India on Saturday that in view of the Government's decision to appoint an Oversight Committee to investigate the various allegations raised by athletes against the Federation, WFI will suspend all ongoing activities with immediate effect, unless the Oversight Committee is formally appointed and takes over the day to day functioning of WFI .  It added,  In view of the direction to suspend all activities immediately, the Sports Ministry has asked WFI to also cancel the ongoing Ranking Tournament in Gonda, UP.   In this regard, the ministry has also asked the WFI to return the entry fees charged to participants for the ongoing event.  The oversight committee of the ministry will have the powers to take all decisions on matters concerning Indian wrestling while also overseeing the day-to-day affairs of the federation.  Earlier in the day, the WFI had rejected all the allegations, including that of sexual harassment against its president, and claimed that the wrestlers' protest was motivated by a  hidden agenda to dislodge the current management .  The WFI denied all the charges in its response to the government's notice and asserted that  there is no scope for arbitrariness and mismanagement   in the federation.  The ministry had sought an explanation from WFI after the country's top wrestlers sat on a dharna and alleged that the federation chief sexually harassed women wrestlers and acts like a  dictator .  Before the wrestlers agreed to end their protest, the Indian Olympic Association had on Friday formed a seven-member committee of its own, headed by M C Mary Kom, to investigate the charges against Sharan.  The IOA panel was constituted even as the wrestlers' sit-in protest entered the third day.  Besides legendary boxer Mary Kom and wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, the panel includes archer Dola Banerjee and Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWLF) president and IOA treasurer Sahdev Yadav.  The IOA committee also has two advocates -- Talish Ray and Shlok Chandra -- besides former shuttler and IOA joint secretary Alaknanda Ashok, who is its vice chairperson.  The decision was taken during the IOA's emergency Executive Council meeting, which was attended by the likes of Olympic champion shooter Abhinav Bindra, Olympic bronze medallist Yogeshwar, along with IOA president PT Usha and joint secretary Kalyan Chaubey.",

        "articleBody": "A former telecom tycoon from the early 2000s who is well aware of the fractious relationship between the state and private enterprises, is now, as a minister, trying to play referee in another equally high stakes match involving a sector that is perceived to be a problem child to many and therefore has often been at logger heads with the taxman and the policymakers \u2013 gaming.The recent move by Rajeev Chandrasekhar to amend the business rules to clarify that online gaming will here on be administered by MEITY and E-Sports by the ministry of sports certainly offers a much needed clarity. Shifting matters out of inter-ministerial and judicial haranguing as well as the state government\u2019s purview must also be lauded as should be the creation of self-regulatory organisation (SRO), mandated to register, certify and approve games as well as providing a grievance redressal mechanism.But amendments to the IT Rules of 2021 \u2013 that are open to public consultation till this month end before the final rules come out later this year \u2013 need a closer look to plug some of the glaring loopholes that may otherwise undermine its own goals and make the thriving online gaming space, poised to become a $8.6 billion industry in FY2027 from the current $2.6 billion as per Lumikai, a specialised VC, virtually ineffectual. And taxation is only one of the bouncers. To be fair, several apex and high courts had already provided some legal cover to games of skill \u2013 like fantasy leagues, rummy, poker, both online and offline \u2013 to negate the earlier criminal liability that shrouded the entire sector. This despite the adolescent industry being caught between a perception battle that online games are nothing but a rich man\u2019s gambit whipping up greed and promoting gambling.The prohibition though continues with games of chance \u2013 lottery, gambling, casinos -- but in our federal structure each states has the power to either regulate or ban them all together.If the legislative power of states are indeed restricted to gambling then skill based games will remain outside their purview, but the degree of the state\u2019s censure powers are yet to be tested in the apex court which is considering appeals against judgments delivered last year by the Madras and Karnataka High Courts.The fine print in the draft amendments are adding to this confusion. By suggesting that gaming platforms like MPL or Dream 11 will have to ensure that the games it makes available on their platforms will not be in contravention to any law that is already in force, including any law in relation to betting or gambling, it has muddled up the stakes. It\u2019s not clear if any state law enacted to regulate betting would fall foul of the newly proposed Central regulations. Tamil Nadu (via a yet-to-be-enforced Ordinance), Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Orissa, Assam, have cracked down on all games. A simple clarification that online games not to be in contravention of any law prohibiting gambling would have made it more simple. As a principle, self regulation is a positive step. We have parallels in the broadcasting/news/OTT space under the aegis of the I&B ministry. However there is a key difference \u2013 The SRO in broadcasting does not have the power to analyse and evaluate all content. The SRO in gaming though will have powers to certify but it is not a statutory body. Various members of the gaming industry will take turns to be office bearers and evaluate the IP of peers and business rivals before a game is allowed to reach the market. There is an obvious conflict of interest in that. Again drawing parallels from the broadcasting SRO architecture, they are designed to fast track decisions and avoid long legal wrangles. A three tier grievance redressal structure, starting with the gaming company, the SRO and an inter-ministerial committee -- for an industry that ought to be nimble will become too bureaucratic and slow things down. More importantly, the babus cannot play arbitrator of rules that they themselves have made. An impartial and independent judicial body should. Even in broadcasting and OTT players, this has become a contentious issue, challenged before at least three high courts. So what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander too, argues Abhishek Malhotra, managing partner, TMT Law Practice.As I have argued before (GST on gaming and gambling: Don\u2019t \u2018game over\u2019 before it has even begun) a levy of 28% -- a sin tax on the full value of consideration or the wagering amount -- would make the sector unviable and significant revenue leakage. This is a, 1100% hike in tax incidence for the 20-plus crore gamers (expected to double by 2025). Instead of absorbing it themselves as platforms do now, the additional 28% burden will be passed on to the users who will lose their shirt even before the game has begun. This is because the tax obligations on wagering will far exceed the operators take rates of around 10% (gross gaming revenues). So if there is an attempt to delineate games of skill and chance, should all gaming activities be categorised as gambling and be charged a sin tax with a catch-all provision? It would be far more prudent to allow games of skills flourish under self-regulation and tax them at 18%. Make gambling mainstream by allowing it under a licenced and stringent regime instead of pushing the whole gig underground. That not only would lead to revenue loss but also expose gamers to far graver consequences. The social dynamics and the addictive impact on children and adults most also take centre stage for in app purchases can indeed become a financial liability on families. Thus parental guidance is a must. It will equally onerous to scrutinise every micro transactions, but technology exists and allows daily time and spending caps, being hardwired into the apps. Seek KYC details for wagers above a certain limit to bring in age barriers. Dealing with addiction has to be an individual\u2019s responsibility. What can the state do to save yourself from yourself. And should it?",

He, however, has not resigned from the Cabinet.On Saturday, the Haryana Director General of Police set up a committee after the minister lodged a complaint against the coach, claiming she had tarnished his image.Till the committee gives its report, Singh said, he is handing over his Sports portfolio to the chief minister on moral grounds.He reiterated that the allegations levelled against him by the woman coach are baseless. In the matter of complaint made by a lady coach of Haryana against Sports Minister Haryana, a case FIR dated 31.12.2022... has been registered at police station Sector 26, Chandigarh and is being investigated,  a Chandigarh police spokesperson said.Singh has been booked under sections 354 (assault or use of criminal force against a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354 A (sexual harassment), 354 B (compelling her to be naked), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the spokesperson said.The junior athletics coach levelled the sexual harassment allegations against Singh on Thursday and filed a police complaint a day later.After receiving a complaint from the woman coach, Chandigarh police had earlier said an inquiry will be conducted into the allegations against the minister I have given a complaint to SSP madam (Senior Superintendent of Police) here. I am hopeful that I will get justice and the Chandigarh Police will investigate my complaint,  the woman told reporters on Friday.She has alleged that Singh contacted her on Instagram after seeing her at a gym and kept insisting that they meet. He messaged me on Instagram and said my National Games certificate is pending and wanted to meet in this regard. Unfortunately, my certificate has been misplaced by my federation and I have been taking it up with the concerned authorities,  the woman said.According to the complaint, the woman agreed to meet Singh at his residence-cum-camp office here with some other documents she had. When she went there, the minister molested her, she claimed. He took me to a side cabin of his residence... placed my documents on the side table and placed his hand on my foot. He then said when he saw me for the first time, he liked me... He said you keep me happy and I will keep you happy,  the woman alleged. I removed his hand and he even tore my T-shirt. I was crying and I raised an alarm and though all his staff was there, no one helped me,  she alleged.Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda had earlier demanded an impartial inquiry into the allegations, while the Indian National Lok Dal asked the Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar-led government to immediately sack Singh and set up a Special Investigation Team to probe the matter.

For e-sports, the Department of Sports under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, has been notified as the nodal department.The government will soon publish rules for online gaming intermediaries and start public consultation on these rules, Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar said on Tuesday.  The rules, to be published by MeitY, will encourage innovation but ensure that there is no illegal content or service, Chandrasekhar said in a tweet. Sources said the upcoming budget is likely to bring more clarity, including taxation issues fced by online gaming companies.96552340 The centre is committed to ensure that the (online gaming) industry is provided with the necessary framework to flourish,  a senior official told ET. This will make it easier for industry to deal with regulation.  A nodal ministry for online gaming has been a long-standing demand of the industry and we welcome this move. This will make it easier to come up with uniform regulations and an eventual comprehensive central framework,  Roland Landers, CEO of the All India Gaming Federation (AIGF) said. Recently, IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the Centre would soon come up with a proper policy, and a new law, to deal with online gaming as all states have been unanimous in their concerns about the serious impact it was causing to society. The appointment of MeitY as the central regulatory authority will provide clarity and certainty to investors, industry and consumers,  said Joy Bhattacharjya, director general, Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports (FIFS). The decision is in line with the government's initiative to push for growth of the animation, visual effects, gaming and comics (AVGC) sector and making India a global hub for online gaming. We are sure that the online gaming industry will grow responsibly under MeitY's guidance. The industry is looking forward to working with MeitY in creating a well-balanced regulatory framework,  he added.In the absence of any central nodal agency and framework, the gaming industry was facing a backlash from some states which had clubbed online gaming with betting and gambling and had proposed a ban on online games of skill, leading to a series of litigations. In May, the Centre set up a seven-member task force to work on regulations for the online gaming industry and identify a nodal ministry to look after the sector's concerns. The task force submitted its report in October. The latest move is in line with the task force's recommendations. MeitY may act as the nodal ministry to regulate online gaming, except for the e-sports category on which the Department of Sports can take the lead,  the report said. This will also segregate e-sports from general online games.E-sports are online games that are played competitively in the form of tournaments and leagues. Some of them are digital or virtual versions of mainstream sports like cricket or football.On Tuesday, ET reported that the government, through the Ministry of Corporate Affairs' Investor Protection and Education Fund (IPEF), was planning to launch an outreach campaign to create awareness about cryptocurrencies and online gaming.",

        "articleBody": "The Government of India on Tuesday gave Esports a major boost by integrating it with mainline sports disciplines in the country.  The President of India, Droupadi Murmu, in exercise of the powers  conferred by clause (3) of article 77 of the Constitution  amended the rules governing Esports and asked the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Sports Ministry to include  e-Sports as part of multi-sports events .  There had been a growing demand for Esports to be included in the curriculum of multi-discipline events after it was included in the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games as a demonstration sport, meaning medals won in the sport were not counted in the official overall medals tally.  But following the President's notification, issued on December 23, that IT Ministry will be the nodal agency for online gaming-related matters and the sports ministry will have to include it in its curriculum, it has come as shot in the arm for Esports enthusiasts.  The International Olympic Committee (IOC) too is going big on popularising e-Sport with Singapore being confirmed to host the inaugural Olympic Esports Week in June next year.  This marks the next big step in supporting the development and integration of virtual sports with the Olympic movement and engaging further with competitive gamers.  The IOC had said in November this year that the Olympic Esports Week would showcase the best of virtual sports -- hybrid physical and simulated sports -- in the four-day festival from June 22 to 25, including exhibiting the latest technologies, panel discussions, education sessions and show matches.  IOC President Thomas Bach had said last month that the inaugural Olympic Esports Week would mark an important milestone  in our ambition to support the growth of virtual sports within the Olympic Movement .  The Indian DOTA 2 team had clinched bronze at the first Commonwealth Esports Championship held in Birmingham in August defeating New Zealand.  The sport will make its debut at the Asian Games to be held in Hangzhou, China next year.  Reacting to the report of its inclusion as a mainline sport, Lokesh Suji, director, Esports Federation of India and vice-president of Asian Esports Federation, said the efforts of the fraternity had finally borne fruit.   We have been constantly working on establishing the difference between esports and iGaming, and finally, our efforts have been fulfilled. We welcome this announcement by our government, which will open new avenues to pour in more investment opportunities in this booming industry.   From now onwards, we will have to build proper infrastructure, training facilities and coaching for our young esports athletes. Only a short time until we see esports being placed in the same league as cricket, football, basketball, etc. and having similar fan power, scale and craze,  said Suji.",

        "description": "The Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) awards, considered the top award for scientific research in India, are set to undergo a revamp. The Centre plans to change the award guidelines, format, and nomination system, similar to the Padma Awards. The revamp will likely introduce new categories and increase the number of awardees. ",
        "datePublished": "2023-09-12T23:41:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "The announcement of the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) awardees 2022 this week- delayed by a year- also probably marks the last of this version of the country's top award for scientific research.ET has gathered reliably that the Centre is set to change all the award guidelines, format and nomination system for the SSB awards before the next cycle. The SSB revamp will be re-aligned much like the 'Padma Awards' to bring in a new format for the awards from 2024 onwards, sources said.Since the 2023 SSB award process has not been initiated so far, it is likely that the new award cycle will miss one year and begin from 2024, government insiders indicated to ET.The eponymous award - often termed as the Nobel Prize for Science in India - is expected to retain the name of Dr Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar, Founder Director of the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) credited with setting up the framework for India S&T infrastructure and policies. Currently, the SSB award is given across seven categories - Biological Sciences, Chemical Sciences, Earth, Atmosphere, Ocean and Planetary Sciences, Engineering Sciences, Mathematical Sciences and Physical Sciences. Typically, 12-14 SSB awards are announced every year.The revamp is expected to add several new categories from technology to innovation, AI and so on to bring in new areas and disciplines that have come up over the years. It is also expected that the number of awardees and awards will be increased, ET has learnt.The award nomination system for the SSB - largely controlled by the CSIR so far - is expected to be changed to a  national  one and one that is  department agnostic .The SSB award revamp is part of the larger  transformation  of awards ecosystem, across ministries, being attempted by the Centre. The science awards, including the recast SSB are also expected to be onboarded to the National Awards Portal which is now hosting several awards that have been revamped.Worry areaThere is also considerable discomfort among many in the scientific community about the shake-up of  award ecosystem  being attempted by the Centre.A September 17, 2022, meeting chaired by the Union home secretary indicated over 800 awards from the science and research ministries and departments may be pruned down to six. A new highest science award- Vigyan Ratan- is also envisaged as part of the plan.Many in the scientific community have also expressed apprehensions that the \u201ctransformation\u201d exercise may end up bringing greater governmental control and influence in the scientific R&D ecosystem and end up \u201cdownsizing\u201d science awards.Others feel that the pruning will end up cutting down the institution level awards that helped encourage and retain young talent.That the SSB 2022 awards were not announced on September 26, 2022 - CSIR Foundation Day - as has been the tradition so far, also led to many a raised eyebrow.Further, the SSB awards for 2019, 2020, 2021 were not conferred in a proper ceremony as is usually done but were, instead, sent by post to awardees, citing the pandemic.The last ceremony for SSB awards was, in fact, held in February 2019 and was addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Transformation of Awards EcosystemGovernment insiders, however, claim that the revamp is only aimed at enhancing the stature of the awards, bringing in clear transparent nomination guidelines and decision making. They also assure that the awards, once revamped, will come with more categories, number of awardees and even greater stature.A concept note on transformation of awards - shared with all ministries earlier - said that there are multiple awards across ministries and sometimes \u201cquestions are raised on the selection process\u201d due to lack of public awareness about the procedure followed.It also emphasised the need for simplification of the entire process of nomination through a common single platform to ensure greater public participation and an objective, transparent and merit-based selection criteria and evaluation matrix.The national awards portal is already functioning. Apart from the Padma Awards, a range of awards by other ministries are now on the portal.The most recent was the National Teachers\u2019 Day awards which has joined the portal and opened its doors this year to higher education teachers as well.",

Speaking to PTI here, he also indicated that he expects investment into the space sector to go up by two to three times from the present level as the Government is keen to support this field.  We need to make sure that we have a good education system which produces the best aeronautics and aerospace people. So, more universities need to create that department and facilities. If necessary, ISRO should have a special programme to improve the educational component of it,  the veteran space scientist, who was the Chairman of the National Education Policy draft committee, said. Research in universities also needs to be brought up to higher levels so that they can contribute to the space programme. Right now, research inputs into the space programme from universities is very limited, whereas ISRO does support research to some extent with various universities.  Eighty per cent of the students go to universities. So, youngsters are all there, bright minds are there. So, we need to improve that. Research, education and innovation, and industrialisation...these are things which can have much more scope , Kasturirangan, a former member of the now defunct Planning Commission of India, said. Kasturirangan said he is extremely happy that the present government has created institutions such as the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) and NewSpace India Limited (NSIL) whIch have promoted industrialisation, commercialisation and freer international collaboration. These initiatives are already showing their outcome in terms of the number of missions that have increased, and type of income that they are generating, among others, he pointed out over the weekend.  So, this is the direction in which it's going and ISRO is core intellectual organisation, will (continue to) undertake cutting edge technology and science activities; the operational capabilities, service capabilities they will hand it over to some of these institutions and they in turn will create organisation systems or industries which will further take up and also through international collaboration and enhance the activities and financial viability,  he said. Asked if funding needs to go up for the space programmes, Kasturirangan, a former member of the Rajya Sabha, said he has seen this government's general disposition towards programmes which are fructifying in the country and doing well.  And the Prime Minister, I know, is very keen that space sector should be supported at all costs, and we have to be right at the top in terms of the countries which are now pioneers in space. Therefore, I don't think the government will be found wanting in terms of support , he said.  Currently, it's between USD two and three billion dollars per year is the kind of investment that we are making (in the space sector). I am sure that we can easily go up by two to three times which is a very large type of money for the type of work we can do because of all sorts of cost-effectiveness and so on,  he said.  So, I don't think this government will starve the organisation of the funds. They have a determination to make sure that India is right at the top and work with countries which are in the forefront of space programmes in the 21st century and be a partner in major ventures on space along with other countries in the world which have similar capabilities, and resources with which we can join up. So, this is something which is a model which is slowly developing. So, I am not worried that we will be found wanting in terms of this,  Kasturirangan added.",

        "articleBody": "BENGALURU: Scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) have developed a new approach to potentially detect and kill cancer cells, especially those which form a solid tumour mass. They have created hybrid nanoparticles made of gold and copper sulphide, which can kill cancer cells using heat, and enable their detection using sound waves, according to a study published in 'ACS Applied Nano Materials'. Early detection and treatment are key in the battle against cancer, noted the Bengaluru-based IISc in a statement on Monday. Copper sulphide nanoparticles have previously received attention for their application in cancer diagnosis, while gold nanoparticles, which can be chemically modified to target cancer cells, have shown anti-cancer effects. In the current study, the IISc team decided to combine these two into hybrid nanoparticles.  These particles have photothermal, oxidative stress, and photoacoustic properties,  says Jaya Prakash, Assistant Professor at the Department of Instrumentation and Applied Physics (IAP), IISc, and one of the corresponding authors of the paper. PhD students Madhavi Tripathi and Swathi Padmanabhan are co-first authors. When light is shined on these hybrid nanoparticles, they absorb the light and generate heat, which can kill cancer cells. These nanoparticles also produce singlet oxygen atoms that are toxic for the cells, the release pointed out.  We want both these mechanisms to kill the cancer cell,  Jaya Prakash explains. The researchers say the nanoparticles can also help diagnose certain cancers. Existing methods such as standalone CT and MRI scans require trained radiology professionals to decipher the images. The photoacoustic property of the nanoparticles allows them to absorb light and generate ultrasound waves, which can be used to detect cancer cells with high contrast once the particles reach them. The ultrasound waves generated from the particles allow for a more accurate image resolution as sound waves scatter less when they pass through tissues compared to light. Scans created from the generated ultrasound waves can also provide better clarity and can be used to measure the oxygen saturation in the tumour, boosting their detection, it was noted.  You can integrate this with existing systems of detection or treatment,  says Ashok M Raichur, Professor at the Department of Materials Engineering, and another corresponding author. For example, the nanoparticles can be triggered to produce heat by shining a light on them using an endoscope that is typically used for cancer screening. Previously developed nanoparticles have limited applications because of their large size. The IISc team used a novel reduction method to deposit tiny seeds of gold onto the copper sulphide surface. The resulting hybrid nanoparticles - less than 8 nm in size - can potentially travel inside tissues easily and reach tumours. The researchers believe that the nanoparticles' small size would also allow them to leave the human body naturally without accumulating, although extensive studies have to be carried out to determine if they are safe to use inside the human body. In the current study, the researchers have tested their nanoparticles on lung cancer and cervical cancer cell lines in the lab. They now plan to take the results forward for clinical development.",

        "articleBody": "E-commerce giant Amazon.com is making its first investment in direct air capture technology, which removes emissions from the atmosphere, by committing to purchase 250,000 tons of removal credits over 10 years, it said on Tuesday. Amazon will purchase the credits from the 1PointFive direct air capture (DAC) plant in Texas, which is being developed by oil company Occidental's Oxy Low Carbon Ventures subsidiary and will use them to help meet its climate target of net zero carbon emissions by 2040. The company did not reveal any financial details of the deal, but developers of DAC technology have said removal credits currently cost in the mid-to-high-triple digits in dollars per metric ton. Many scientists believe extracting billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere annually, by using nature or technology, is the only way to meet goals set under the U.N. Paris climate agreement to curb climate change because so many emissions are still being generated by the use of fossil fuels. Projects that suck carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the air can generate removal credits that can then be bought and used by companies to help offset emissions they are unable to cut from their business. Although the technological solutions are still far from proven at a cost and scale that could allow a global roll-out, tech giants have increasingly backed DAC. Microsoft last week signed a multi-year deal for the purchase of 315,000 metric tons with U.S. project developer Heirloom. Amazon's carbon footprint for 2022 was 71.27 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, including Scope 3 emissions which are those generated indirectly from sources the company does not control or own, such as the emissions generated by staff flying for work. Jamey Mulligan, head of carbon neutralization science and strategy at Amazon said an  all hands on deck approach  was needed to scale up the technology.  We have to have massive scale very quickly, 1PointFive and Occidental have significant knowledge, expertise and workforce and experience that's needed to scale industrial plants like this,  he said. Some green groups have criticised the role of oil companies in developing plants to remove carbon dioxide. The 1PointFive project was one of two large-scale DAC  hubs  last month selected for the largest U.S. Department of Energy grants available for the technology. Mulligan said Amazon is focused on cutting its own emissions and scaling up use of renewable energy but will also likely use a portfolio of carbon offsets, including those from nature-based projects, to help reach its net zero target.",

He also participated in an industry roundtable organised by the US Embassy.  In Bengaluru, he participated in a biotechnology roundtable organised by DBT and in Gandhinagar, his last stop, Panchanathan led the US delegation at the G20 Chief Science Advisers' Roundtable, a media release said.   In the last five years, NSF has invested nearly USD 150 million in India through over 200 projects. Just this last year, we launched 35 new joint projects with India's Department of Science & Technology in emerging technologies,  Panchanathan was quoted as saying by the NSF on his return from India.   This joint funding opportunity strengthens the foundation of cooperation, collaboration, and joint investment in science and engineering by unlocking fantastic new discoveries, innovations and opportunities across industries like semiconductor research, next generation communication systems, cyber-security, sustainability and green technologies, and intelligent transportation systems,  said Panchanathan.  According to NSF, the new agreement with MeitY provides fresh funding for joint projects in applied research areas and builds on an Implementation Arrangement signed by Panchanathan and MeitY Secretary Alkesh Kumar Sharma, at NSF headquarters in May.  It also advances the mutual interests of India and the US, outlined in a joint statement made by President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June, during the latter's visit to the US which included a stop at NSF's headquarters, the media release said.  On August 22, Panchanathan signed an Implementation Arrangement during a ceremony alongside many notable people, including US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti, India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu, Secretary for DBT and the Department of Science & Technology Rajesh S Gokhale, and Minister of State for Science & Technology Jitendra Singh.   This is a historic moment for India and the US,  said Panchanathan. This implementation arrangement provides a framework to encourage collaborations between research communities and sets out the principles that will help make joint activities successful and productive, he added.  It has potential to tackle, societies' most pressing challenges, spur economic growth, and advance technologies and innovations in critical research areas like systems and synthetic biology, protein design, cellular and biochemical engineering, and circular bioeconomy engineering, among others, he said.  NSF said Panchanathan's trip to India reaffirmed both nations' commitment to shared values and aspirations and illustrated the director's belief that teamwork on a global scale among like-minded players powers scalable opportunities, supercharged progress and universal prosperity - a notion which implicitly endorses India's G20 presidency theme:  Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,  or  One Earth, One Family, One Future.

        "articleBody": "India is becoming a force to be reckoned with in space technology and other countries are now keen to join hands with the country following the success of the Chandrayaan-3 mission, senior scientists said on Thursday. The successful Chandrayaan-3 mission put India in the elite club of nations that have soft landed on lunar surface. India has also become the first country to land on the southern pole of the Moon.  Earlier the number of people congratulating ISRO on its missions was very few. Nowadays, there are copious (congratulatory messages) and abundant appreciation because we are becoming a power now,  Dr P V Venkitakrishnan, ISRO Director (retired) and Materials and Rocket manufacturing expert told PTI. Armed with the success of Chandrayaan-3 mission, ISRO is lining up a series of missions like the Mangalyaan-2 Mars Orbiter Mission, Gaganyaan Human Spaceflight programme and also the Sun mission Aditya-L1.  (Yesterday's successful event) is a definite boost to energise anybody who is working in ISRO or who wants to join ISRO in future,  he said to a query.  This (success of Chandrayaan-3 mission) is a shot in the arm for us and similar missions are coming up. We have to travel more to reach for the Aditya-L1 mission. Similarly inter-planetary missions are coming, Chandrayaan-4 also I think may happen,  he said. According to ISRO Chairman S Somanath, the Aditya-L1 mission is expected to launch next month from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. The rocket will be integrated with the launch complex in a day or two, he had said at the Mission Operations Complex at ISTRAC, Bengaluru soon after the success of the Chandrayaan 3 mission, on Wednesday.  It (success of Chandrayaan-3 mission) gives confidence to configure missions to not only go to the Moon, but also to go to Mars, sometimes (perhaps) land on Mars, maybe in future go to Venus and other planets,  he had said. Venkitakrishnan said,  India and China are also becoming equal powers and nobody will ally with them (China) because of their nature.  He said that other countries are collaborating and allying with India now  because of space only .  We are becoming a super power now. And it is really going to help us in all the missions in the future in a very big way with increased dedication and enthusiasm.  he said. Dr T V Venkateswaran, Scientist at Vigyan Prasar, GOI Department of Science and Technology, in a brief interaction with PTI spoke about what Chandrayaan-3's success means for collaborations between academia and the Indian space industry  Technology and software instruments were designed, developed, conceived and executed by ISRO and Indian academia together in the past.  Many institutions of higher learning were also closely collaborating with ISRO, which goes to show that if industry and academia in India can come together, a lot of very interesting work can also be done in space technology, he added.  The mainstay of ISRO is to provide societal applications with space technology and that is what they concentrate upon. However, being a big country with more than a billion population and a long heritage of science and technology, it is also important that ISRO looks at space science and space research and that is how all these deep space missions are emerging,  he said. The next major mission ISRO is planning to undertake is the Aditya-L1 mission which is to study or put a telescope to observe the Sun, in particular to predict and also identify solar storms and activities of the Sun, he said.  ISRO is doing this project in collaboration with Indian astrophysicists -- the astronomy community -- and that is how the whole instrumentation, satellite and spacecraft is designed and developed,  he added. The success of Chandrayaan-3 will open up more collaborations between ISRO and academia and scientific institutions in the country in realising some of the space science projects, he said. Talking about the Gaganyaan mission, he said,  In 1961, a human reached space with (Soviet Cosmonaut) Yuri Gagarin making a few rounds around the Earth. Since then, a lot of development has taken place in space, and the international space station has been hosting at least three humans continuously from 2020 to 2023. Therefore, space is becoming a new frontier.  India's Gaganyaan mission is also an attempt at sending humans to space. If and when there is an International effort to establish a new space station, India could possibly get a seat at the table thanks to the Gaganyaan effort, he added.",

        "articleBody": "Vikram Sarabhai was succeeded by brilliant and capable leaders, but it was his vision that continued to shape India\u2019s space programme long after his deathIndians looking at the night sky on Wednesday might have felt the moon shone brighter than it ever did before. The silver orb that hangs over us waxing and waning every fortnight acquired a sudden familiarity and a proximity with the successful advance of the Chandrayaan-3 mission. The momentous occasion is the achievement of hundreds of scientists and engineers over many years. But it is also an opportune time to remember the man who started it all and whose name, since 1974, has graced a small, bowlshaped crater (the Sarabhai crater) on the Mare Serenitatis in the north-east quadrant of the Moon.Vikram Sarabhai, founder of the Indian space programme, was born in 1919 in a family of textile barons. Among the world\u2019s wealthiest industrialists, the Sarabhais were unusually political: they were close to Gandhi and allied themselves firmly with the anti-colonial struggle. Surrounded by luxury, spoilt for choice and yet aware of his family legacy of political ac tivism, Vikram chose the path of science.In an era marked by the excitement of new discoveries regarding the atom, Vikram became a physicist. Unlike others who studied cosmic rays for the atomic particles thrown up by them, he came to be interested in cosmic rays as a tool to study outer space. His interest tied in with an emerging trend. In 1961-62, against a background of a global push in space research by the International Council of Scientific Unions, the Department of Atomic Energy (supported by prime minister Nehru and DAE secretary Homi Bhabha) initiated space research in India and set up a sounding rocket programme under Vikram\u2019s leadership.The idea of a poor and newly independent country like India entering a field requiring technology and investment such as space research seemed unimaginably audacious. And the programme was equally so, with Vikram encouraging bright, young scientists and engineers such as Vasant Gowarikar and Abdul Kalam (among many) to join and setting them challenging tasks with threadbare resources on the beaches of Thumba, a fishing village in Kerala. Henri Cartier Bresson captured the slapdash energy of the enterprise in evocative black and white photographs, including an iconic one of two scientists casually transporting a nose cone on a bicycle.The cheekiness was counterbalanced by a highly evolved vision. In 1963, when the Soviets had just about launched the world\u2019s first synchronous satellite, Vikram was already thinking of using satellites for communications. He envisaged applications for space in agriculture, forestry, oceanography, mineral prospecting and cartography. And in a 1966 paper on \u2018Space Activity for Developing Countries\u2019, he hoped that space activity would stimulate growth in electronics and cybernetics and create a new culture of collaboration between countries and specialisations.Vikram\u2019s dream was to link technology with development, serving the needs of the masses while nurturing a highly sophisticated work culture and scientific abilities. One of his favourite phrases was \u2018leapfrog ging\u2019 which referred to his faith in the power of technology to enable developing countries to circumvent the long processes followed by the west. His ideas created a \u2018big sensation internationally\u2019, according to Japanese space scientist Hideo Itokawa, and birthed ambitious schemes such as the world\u2019s first experiment in direct broadcasting by satellite using an American ATS-6 on loan to transmit locally produced content to 2,400 backward Indian villages.Vikram Sarabhai died young, at the age of 52 in December 1971. He was succeeded by brilliant and capable leaders, but he also left behind a vision which continued to shape the programme long after his death.Now that the talented and spirited people of the Indian Space Research Organisation have scaled a new horizon, made us proud and euphoric by taking us to the moon, it is tempting to speculate on how the visionary founder of the space programme might have viewed the potential impact of this achievement.Let me borrow some of his own words as a guide.Here is what he had to say about the effects of science for example: \u201cA person who has imbibed the ways of science injects into a situation a new way of looking at it, hopefully perhaps a degree of enlightenment.\u201d So perhaps this is what he would hope to gain from the moon mission: a broadening of minds, a trigger to innovation, and greater wisdom.Shah is the author of \u2018Vikram Sarabhai: A Life\u2019",

        "articleBody": "WASHINGTON: The United States is seeking a six-month extension to a science and technology agreement with China so that it can undergo negotiations with Beijing to  amend and strengthen  the landmark deal, the State Department said on Wednesday.For over 40 years, the agreement between the two countries has yielded cooperation across a range of scientific and technical fields, a powerful sign that the rivals could set aside their disputes and work together.The deal, signed when Beijing and Washington established diplomatic ties in 1979 and renewed about every five years since, has resulted in cooperation in areas from atmospheric and agricultural science to basic research in physics and chemistry.But concerns about China's growing military prowess and theft of U.S. scientific and commercial achievements have prompted questions about whether the Science and Technology Agreement (STA), set to expire on Aug. 27, should continue. This short-term six-month extension will keep the agreement in force while we seek authority to undertake negotiations to amend and strengthen the terms of the STA. It does not commit the United States to a longer-term extension,  a State Department spokesperson told Reuters.The department said the deal provides consistent standards for government-to-government scientific cooperation, and if it lapsed each agency would have to negotiate individual arrangements with Beijing. We are clear-eyed to the challenges posed by (China's) national strategies on science and technology, Beijing's actions in this space, and the threat they pose to U.S. national security and intellectual property, and are dedicated to protecting the interests of the American people,  the spokesperson said.The chair of the U.S. House of Representatives' select committee on China, Mike Gallagher, and other Republicans have said the deal should be scrapped, citing concerns about industrial espionage, forced technology transfers and other tactics that could fuel China's military modernization.Chinese officials have hoped to extend the deal, and have said publicly they approached the U.S. last year to discuss renewal, but that Washington had been conducting a review of the agreement.China's embassy in Washington did not respond immediately to a request for comment.Proponents of renewing the deal argue that without it, the U.S. would lose valuable insight into China's technical advances. Nonetheless, many analysts say the agreement must be fundamentally reworked to safeguard U.S. innovation in a time of heightened strategic competition with China.",

        "articleBody": "The successful soft landing of India's ambitious Chandrayaan-3 mission on the Moon's enigmatic south pole has captured the attention and admiration of the scientific community. Leading scientists and experts said this monumental accomplishment not only marks India's indelible imprint on lunar exploration but also demonstrates the prowess of human collaboration, determination, and cutting-edge technology.  Dr. Chrisphin Karthick, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bengaluru, expressed his elation.  The successful landing of Chandrayaan-3 is a testament to our collective progress towards space travel. It showcases the beauty of unity in diversity as we sail the cosmic seas together,  he told PTI.   Slow and steady - reaching the goal is better than saying we won the race. I emphasise this since many are comparing it with our friendly nation programmes. It's good to say we earthlings won the race in sailing the universe in many ways,  Karthick added.  The Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 and its objectives are to demonstrate safe and soft-landing on the lunar surface, roving on the Moon, and to conduct in-situ scientific experiments. Chandrayaan-2 had failed in its lunar phase when its lander 'Vikram' crashed into the surface of the Moon following anomalies in the braking system in the lander while attempting a touch down on September 7, 2019. The Chandrayaan programme's maiden mission was in 2008.  Aakash Sinha, Professor of Practice at the Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, Delhi-NCR, and CEO of Omnipresent Robot Tech, hailed ISRO's (Indian Space Research Organisation) feat as a  monumental achievement  that will inspire a new generation of aspiring scientists and explorers.   With this unparalleled accomplishment, India has etched its name in history by becoming the first country to land in this lunar region,  Sinha, who was involved in developing the software for the Pragyan rover of Chandrayaan-3, told PTI.  The lander module comprising the lander (Vikram) and the 26-kg rover (Pragyan) made the soft landing near the south polar region of the Moon at 6.04 pm, less than a week after a similar Russian lander crashed.   ISRO's Chandrayaan mission, which was the pioneer in discovering water on the moon, continues to break barriers and set new standards. Beyond its immediate scientific impact, this mission holds the promise of inspiring a new generation of young minds to join the realms of space exploration and science,  he added.  Sinha highlighted that the mission's accomplishments will  break barriers and set new standards,  positioning India as a frontrunner in lunar research.   Our team worked relentlessly with ISRO to develop the software for the navigation of the Pragyan rover. We are delighted to see our work and research reach the Moon,  he added.  Astrophysicist Sandip Chakraborty noted that the significance of Chandrayaan-3's soft landing cannot be overstated.   Soft landing is a start for future activities, such as science of the Moon and from the Moon. It is a gateway to the outer world,  the director of the Indian Centre for Space Physics, Kolkata, told PTI.  He emphasised that this achievement propels India into an elite group of spacefaring nations, where it can stake its claim to the Moon's scientific and exploratory potential.  India became the fourth country in the world to perform a soft landing on the Moon. Only three countries namely Russia, the US, and China have achieved this remarkable feat.   The successful landing imbibes the confidence in every citizen. Students ambition increases. No future regulation on the Moon can be made without the concurrence of India. So, it would be a paradigm shift event in the Indian context,  Chakraborty added.  Underpinning this success to the remarkable contribution of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered systems developed by ISRO and the Indian academia, scientists believe these systems enabled the craft to navigate the lunar surface with precision, detect hazards, and ultimately achieve a safe landing.  Dr. TV Venkateswaran, a scientist at Vigyaan Prasar, an autonomous organisation under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), and member of the public outreach committee of the Astronomical Society of India, lauded this integration of technology, saying that it will inspire young minds and bolster scientific curiosity.   The safe and soft landing shows that the AI-powered algorithms have worked well. The same algorithms can be tweaked and used to control other autonomous vehicles,  Venkateswaran told PTI.   The success will give a boost to the morale of ISRO and also scientists across the country. Further, it will pave the way for the consistent study of the Moon and the international community. The same technology will also help ISRO land on Mars in a future mission,  he added.  The experts also concur that this success is not an endpoint but a stepping stone toward further exploration.   No future regulation on the Moon can be made without the concurrence of India,  Chakraborty emphasised, hinting at the country's newfound influence in shaping lunar exploration policies.  He said the successful landing of Chandrayaan-3 resonates as a clarion call for aspiring scientists, space enthusiasts, and the global community at large.  Venkateswaran said the common public may enjoy the fruits of science and technology or have a modicum of exposure to the school's general science curriculum. However, they hardly get an opportunity to experience science in its making.   The massive coverage and enthusiasm generated by the media outreach allow the common public to share science in the making. The incredible excitement naturally attracts the young towards science and technology,  he added.",

Objects on the Moon weigh significantly less due to its weaker gravitational pull, approximately one-sixth of Earth's. ",
        "datePublished": "2023-08-22T15:03:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "As anticipation grows for India's planned Chandrayaan-3 lunar landing on Wednesday, an expert delves into the fascinating world of Moon exploration. The Moon has captivated human curiosity for centuries, and with each new mission, we uncover more about its geological history, composition and potential for scientific discovery.  Dr. TV Venkateswaran, a scientist at Vigyan Prasar, an autonomous organisation under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), and member of the public outreach committee of the Astronomical Society of India, answers key questions about the Moon's geological evolution, the significance of its south pole, the presence of water and ice, and India's ambitious plans for lunar exploration.  1. What is Moon's geological history and evolution? In other words, how old it is, and when/how did it form? The Moon is estimated to be about 4.5 billion years old, roughly the same age as the Earth. The leading theory about the Moon's formation suggests that a Mars-sized celestial body collided with the young Earth, and the debris from this collision eventually coalesced to form the lunar body. However, current geological evidence from Moon suggests that it may be younger by just 60 million years compared to Earth.  2. How much do things weigh on the Moon, relative to Earth, and why? The Moon's gravitational pull is much weaker than Earth's, approximately one-sixth of Earth's gravity. As a result, objects on the Moon weigh significantly less than they do on Earth. This is due to the Moon's smaller size and mass. For example, a person weighing 68 kilograms on the Earth would weigh only over 11 kg on the Moon.  3. Why do Indian scientists want to land on Moon's south pole? The lunar south pole has become a focal point for exploration due to its unique features and potential scientific value. It is believed to host a vast reservoir of water ice in permanently shadowed regions. The presence of water is of immense significance for future space exploration, as it can be converted into resources such as drinking water, oxygen and and hydrogen for rocket fuel. Also, the permanently sunlit area in the region has a temperature of around minus 50 to 10 degrees Celsius, which provide better chemical condition for the electronics onboard the rover and lander to work properly.  4. What is in the lunar south pole? Is the terrain and geology there the same as elsewhere on the Moon or do we have no idea? The terrain and geology at the Moon's south pole are distinct from other regions. Permanently shadowed craters provide extremely cold conditions that allow water ice to accumulate and persist. The unique geography of the south pole also creates regions of perpetual sunlight, which can be harnessed for solar power. The terrain varies from rugged landscapes to relatively flat plains, offering a diverse range of scientific opportunities.  5. Why is a region of the lunar south pole permanently shadowed? This depends on the Moon's geology. The Moon's axis is only slightly tilted relative to its orbit around the Earth. This results in certain areas near the poles being in permanent shadow. These shadows create extremely cold environments where temperatures can plummet to very low levels. These frigid conditions are conducive to preserving water ice for billions of years.  6. Does water/ice exist on the lunar south pole? Chandrayaan-1 seemed to have suggested it. Yes, water ice has been confirmed to exist in the Moon's south pole region. Data from various lunar missions, including India's Chandrayaan 1, launched in 2008, have indicated the presence of water molecules in these permanently shadowed regions. This discovery has opened up exciting possibilities for sustained lunar exploration.  7. Is water/ice critical for future lunar exploration? Water ice is a critical resource for future lunar exploration and even beyond. It can be converted into breathable air, drinking water, and most importantly, hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel. This could revolutionise space travel by reducing the need to transport these resources from Earth, making long-duration missions more feasible.  8. Does India plan to send a manned mission to the Moon in the future? While ISRO has expressed its intention to send astronauts to space as part of its Gaganyaan mission, there are no plans yet to send human missions to the Moon in the near future.102907493",

        "description": "Traditional semiconductor devices are either made of amorphous silicon or amorphous oxides, both of which are not flexible. Adding polymers to the oxide semiconductors may increase their flexibility, but there is a limit to how much can be added without compromising the semiconductors performance.",
        "datePublished": "2023-07-11T16:33:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "A team of scientists at the Department of Materials Engineering, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), has developed a super flexible, composite semiconductor material that can have possible applications in next-generation flexible or curved displays, foldable phones and wearable electronics. Traditional semiconductor devices \u2013 such as transistors, the building blocks of most electronic circuits \u2013 used in display industries are either made of amorphous silicon or amorphous oxides, both of which are not flexible and strain tolerant at all. Adding polymers to the oxide semiconductors may increase their flexibility, but there is a limit to how much can be added without compromising the semiconductor\u2019s performance. In the current study, published in Advanced Materials Technologies, the researchers have found a way to fabricate a composite containing a significant amount of polymer \u2013 up to 40% of the material weight \u2013 using a solution-process technique, specifically inkjet printing. In contrast, previous studies have reported only up to 1-2% polymer addition. Interestingly, the approach enabled the semiconducting properties of the oxide semiconductor to remain unaltered with the polymer addition. The added large quantity of polymer also made the composite semiconductor highly flexible and foldable without deteriorating its performance, the IISc said in a press release. The composite semiconductor is made up of two materials \u2013 a water-insoluble polymer such as ethyl cellulose that provides flexibility, and indium oxide, a semiconductor which brings in excellent electronic transport properties. To design the material, the researchers mixed the polymer with the oxide precursor in such a way that interconnected oxide nanoparticle channels are formed (around phase-separated polymer islands) through which electrons can move from one end of a transistor (source) to the other (drain), ensuring a steady current flow. The key to form these connected pathways, the researchers found, was the choice of the right kind of water-insoluble polymer that does not mix with the oxide lattice when the oxide semiconductor is being fabricated. \u201cThis \u2018phase separation\u2019 and the formation of polymer-rich islands helps in crack arrest, making it super flexible,\u201d said Subho Dasgupta, associate professor at the Department of Materials Engineering, and corresponding author of the study. Semiconductor materials are usually fabricated using deposition techniques such as sputtering. Instead, Dasgupta\u2019s team uses inkjet printing to deposit their material onto various flexible substrates ranging from plastics to paper. In the present study, a polymer material called Kapton has been used. Just like words and images printed on paper, electronic components can be printed on any surface using special functional inks containing either electrically conducting, semiconducting or insulating materials. However, there are challenges. \u201cSometimes it is very difficult to get a continuous and homogeneous film. Therefore, we had to optimise certain protocols, for example, preheating the printed semiconductor layer on the Kapton substrate prior to high temperature annealing,\u201d according to first author Mitta Divya, former PhD student at the Department of Materials Engineering and currently a postdoc at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia. Another challenge is ensuring the right environmental conditions under which the ink can be printed. \u201cIf the humidity is too low, you can\u2019t print, because the ink dries up within the nozzle,\u201d Dasgupta said. In the future, he added, such printed semiconductors can be used to fabricate fully printed and flexible television screens, wearables, and large electronic billboards alongside printed organic light emitting diode (OLED) display front-ends. These printed semiconductors will be low-cost and easy to manufacture, which could potentially revolutionise the display industry. His team has obtained a patent for their material and plans to test its shelf-life and quality control from device to device before it can be scaled up for mass production. They also plan to look for other polymers that can help design such flexible semiconductors.",

Such a mechanism is sought to be developed that will closely follow up the growth of these startups, see how to sustain them so as to ensure that they are not lost out, especially those startups that have received technical and financial support from the government,  the minister said. He was chairing a high-level joint meeting of different science ministries and departments, including Science & Technology, Biotechnology, CSIR, Earth Sciences and Atomic Energy.  Singh said that a mechanism was necessary as the number of startups has risen to more than one lakh.  He had earlier suggested that a presentation be prepared, in collaboration with the NITI Aayog, to identify factors that could possibly be constraints for some startups.  Accordingly, a presentation was made at the Thursday's meeting by Chintan Vaishnav from the NITI Aayog. The presentation pointed out that lack of innovation, skilled workforce and funds could possibly be the major factors adversely affecting the sustainability of some startups. The minister proposed that an exercise could be undertaken to assess whether the startups could be identified by a  Unique ID  for effective monitoring across all sectors.  Singh said under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government was providing every kind of technical as well as financial support for ideas and innovations to grow and sustain.  He said as a result India has emerged as the leading startup ecosystem in the world with more than one lakh startups and more than 100 Unicorns and the time has come to strategise sustainability.

        "description": "The US-China Science and Technology Agreement signed when Beijing and Washington established diplomatic ties in 1979 and renewed about every five years since, has been hailed as a stabilising force for the countries' relations.",
        "datePublished": "2023-06-18T09:38:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "For over 40 years, a landmark agreement between the United States and China has yielded cooperation across a range of scientific and technical fields, a powerful sign that the rivals could set aside their disputes and work together. Now with bilateral relations in their worst state in decades, a debate is underway within the US government about whether to let the US-China Science and Technology Agreement (STA) expire later this year, three officials familiar with the discussions said. With Antony Blinken in Beijing on the first visit by a secretary of state in five years and expectations low for any bilateral breakthrough, the debate over the oldest US-China bilateral cooperation accord mirrors a bigger question dividing policy makers: do the benefits to the US of engaging with China outweigh the risk of empowering a competitor who may play by different rules? The agreement, signed when Beijing and Washington established diplomatic ties in 1979 and renewed about every five years since, has been hailed as a stabilising force for the countries' relations, with collaboration in areas from atmospheric and agricultural science to basic research in physics and chemistry. It laid the foundation for a boom in academic and commercial exchanges. Those exchanges helped China grow into a technology and military powerhouse, but concerns about Beijing's theft of US scientific and commercial achievements have prompted questions about whether the agreement - set to expire on August 27 - should continue. Proponents of renewing the STA argue that ending it would stifle academic and commercial cooperation. While the dominant US view appears to be in favor of renewal, a growing contingent of officials and lawmakers believe cooperating on science and technology makes less sense given competition between the countries, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.  Extending the Science and Technology Agreement between the US and China would only further jeopardise our research and intellectual property,  said Representative Mike Gallagher, the Republican chair of a congressional select committee on China.  The administration must let this outdated agreement expire.  The State Department declined to comment on  internal deliberations on negotiations.  The National Security Council also declined to comment. China's embassy in Washington said Chinese officials had approached the US a year ago to talk about the deal, which it said formed the basis for 40 years of  fruitful  cooperation.  As far as we know, the US side is still conducting an internal review on the renewal of the agreement,  embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said, adding that both sides could consider adjustments to the original deal.  It is hoped that the US side will expedite the internal review before the expiration of the agreement,  he said. Renew, expire or renegotiate? Inside the US government, including the State Department, which leads the negotiations, there are competing views about whether to renew the pact, let it expire or renegotiate to add safeguards against industrial espionage and require reciprocity in data exchanges, the officials said. Given the state of US-China ties, trying to renegotiate could derail the agreement, they said. US businesses have long complained about Chinese government policies that require technology transfer, and experts warn about state-sponsored theft of everything from Monsanto crop seeds to data about NASA's space shuttle designs. The administration of President Joe Biden has sharpened the focus on technological competition.  Technology will be the cutting-edge arena of global competition in the period ahead in the way nuclear missiles were the defining feature of the Cold War,  US Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell told a Hudson Institute forum in June, adding that the US  will not cede the high ground.  Proponents of renewing the deal argue that without it, the US would lose valuable insight into China's technical advances.  China friend or China foe, the US needs access to China to understand what's happening on the ground,  said Denis Simon, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who studies technology strategy in China, adding that it was important for the US to negotiate a fundamentally new agreement.  The advocates for renewal are trying to keep this (issue) a little bit under the radar because they don't want the China bashers to get a piece of this and try to rip it apart,  he said. Anna Puglisi, a former US counterintelligence official focused on East Asia and now a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, said science and technology cooperation had at one time been the  feel good  part of relations, but that has changed. She said there are questions about what renewed cooperation could achieve at a time when China's national security laws now cover the export of data and the country is taking steps to limit foreign access to its domestic academic databases.  There has to be transparency and there has to be reciprocity,  said Puglisi.  And the US government needs to do a full accounting of what have we gotten out of this besides a couple of meetings.  ",

        "articleBody": "If things go as planned, the Indian Space Research Organisation would launch its ambitious Chandrayaan-3 mission aimed at demonstrating critical technologies to land the spacecraft on the south pole of the moon in less than two months. Chandrayaan-3 mission carries scientific instruments to study the thermo-physical properties of the lunar regolith, lunar seismicity, lunar surface plasma environment and elemental composition in the vicinity of the landing site.  Chandrayaan-3 mission is scheduled in July second week,  a senior official of the Bengaluru-headquartered national space agency under the Department of Space told PTI on Thursday. While the scope of these scientific instruments on the lander and the rover would fit in the theme of 'Science of the Moon', another experimental instrument would study the spectro-polarimetric signatures of the Earth from the lunar orbit, which would fit in the theme of 'Science from the Moon', according to ISRO officials. In March this year, Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft successfully completed the essential tests that validated its capability to withstand the harsh vibration and acoustic environment that the spacecraft would face during its launch. These tests were particularly challenging, considering the fact that the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft, which would be launched by LVM3 (Launch Vehicle Mark-III) (earlier referred as GSLV Mk III) from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota, is a composite of three modules -- propulsion, lander and rover.  Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe landing and roving on the lunar surface. It consists of Lander and Rover configuration , an ISRO official said. The propulsion module, which has Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) payload to study the spectral and Polari metric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit, would carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km lunar orbit. Lander payloads are: 'Chandra's Surface Thermophysical Experiment' to measure the thermal conductivity and temperature; 'Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity' for measuring the seismicity around the landing site; and 'Langmuir Probe' to estimate the plasma density and its variations. A passive Laser Retroreflector Array from the US space agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is also accommodated for lunar laser ranging studies. Rover payloads are: 'Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer' and 'Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy' for deriving the elemental composition in the vicinity of the landing site. The Lander would have the capability to soft land at a specified lunar site and deploy the Rover which would carry out in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility. The main function of the propulsion module is to carry the lander module from launch vehicle injection till final lunar 100 km circular polar orbit and separate it. Apart from this, the propulsion module also has one scientific payload as a value addition which would be operated post separation of the lander module, it was noted.",

Evidence of the barriers and challenges to technological learning, innovation and development, and upgradation of Indian industries shall be used for devising policies, programmes, and partnerships to strengthen innovation outcomes and benefits,  said Akhilesh Gupta, Head Policy Coordination and Programme Management Division.  The report suggested that the government may consider fiscal and non-fiscal mechanisms to help firms improve their risk appetite in pursuit of innovation.  It also recommended an innovation-linked incentive scheme to help firms, especially MSMEs, to address the financial risks linked to innovation uncertainty.  The government should co-fund all research, even research and innovation that fails, the report said.   While the benefits of the scheme can be linked to the output and outcome indicators, the purpose is to help firms address internal enablers and barriers, hence it is particularly important to include innovation failure as a potential outcome, and the related learnings are captured,  the report said.  The report said the government may consider launching funding allocation for pre-competitive, collaborative industry-focused research and innovation, drawing inspiration from the success of similar programmes in countries as diverse as Australia, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Israel, Japan and the Republic of Korea.",

        "articleBody": "The government should consider launching a 'PLI Plus' scheme with focus on development of new products, industrial designs and enhancing productivity with a view to boost domestic manufacturing, economic think tank GTRI said on Sunday. A production-linked incentives scheme (PLI) is under implementation by the government with a budgetary outlay of about Rs 2 lakh crore for 14 sectors such as white goods, mobile, telecommunication and auto components.  The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) report said that creating sustainable and competitive manufacturing is imperative to increase the share of manufacturing in GDP to 25 per cent by 2030, up from 15 per cent at present.   This will require shifting focus to one step back. From quick manufacturing outcomes to R&D, reverse engineering, and deep work.   This can be done under the Make in India framework with the launch of eight PLI Plus initiatives. These initiatives will strengthen the foundation of Indian manufacturing and aspire to bring the expertise level at par with developed countries like Germany, the US, Japan etc,  GTRI co-founder Ajay Srivastava said.  Under the initiative, he called for focus on laying the foundation for new product development; enhancing productivity of entire product sectors; supporting industrial design, development and manufacturing to cut imports; and boost ease of doing business measures.  For the initiative, he suggested the government use Rs 1 lakh crore from the existing funds.  Creation of global quality basic science research set up; inviting more Suzuki, GE and Apple type of firms in india; developing end-to-end product ecosystems; supporting manufacturing of products made by small and medium-size firms; and localising production of fertilizer and plastics will help India strengthen foundation of its manufacturing and aspire to bring the expertise level at par with developed countries, it added.   India must develop expertise in basic sciences, chemistry, metals, electronics, etc. These require long-term and sustained investment and collaborations with institutions across the world. Most such expertise is available only with firms located in Germany, Japan, and the US,  it said.  India imported machinery of value USD 54 billion in 2022 and therefore India needs to reverse engineer these to enable local, high-quality manufacturing, it said, adding a beginning may be made by reverse-engineering products such as machinery for textiles sector, mining, and agriculture.   India imported fertilizers worth USD 17 billion and plastics products of value USD 27 billion in 2022. Technology for making these products is at least five decades old, and India has abundant raw materials. We must explore if most imports of fertilizer and plastics serve the interests of the trading lobby,  the report said.  Further, it suggested that the Ministry of MSME and the Department of Science and Technology devise an intensive program to identify high-potential existing manufacturers and handhold them to upgrade.   A beginning may be made with the following products. These are imported in large quantities,  it said.  The GTRI further said that most electronic products are made with lakhs of components and India must focus on developing this sector for sustainable advantage.  Currently, India imports most components.   Our component strategy should concentrate on developing a component hub to facilitate quick imports, setting up manufacturing for low-end components, and allowing credit for duty-free imports to firms,  it said, adding the government should look at setting up component hubs for prompt supply of imported components.  Component hubs will be Bonded Cargo warehouses allowing vendors to import and store components without payment of duty. The hubs will trigger domestic electronic and IT hardware goods ecosystem development, the report said.",

Addressing the G20 Space Economy Leaders meeting in Shillong, Singh said the Union Cabinet has approved the Indian Space Policy 2023 to give further boost to private investments and encourage private participation in all areas of space activities.  The reforms aim to make private industries co-travellers in India's space journey by allowing them to undertake independent end-to-end space activities. The increased private industry participation will eventually result in increased contribution of India in the global space economy,  the minister said addressing the gathering in Shillong virtually. The G20 Space Economy Leaders meeting is being organised under India's G20 presidency by the Department of Space. Singh said over these years, space technology has penetrated all walks of life and as a result, there is a huge demand for space-based services which have huge commercial potential. He said the government decided to open up the space sector for the Indian private industry through the 2020 space sector reforms to enhance their participation in end-to-end space activities with hand holding from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Singh said a nodal entity, called the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Center (IN-SPACe), has been created towards promoting and authorising private industries participation.  The first privately built sounding rocket was launched last November and a space start-up has established a launch pad inside ISRO's launch complex. A few start-ups have built and launched satellites,  he said, adding that the industry has welcomed the formation of IN-SPACe.",

The Science and Technology minister made these remarks after reviewing the functioning of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Mumbai. Singh said the rising share of nuclear power in India's energy basket would help it get closer to the commitment of achieving the net zero target by 2070. He said the Department of Atomic Energy has been given the target of achieving 20 gigawatts (GW) capacity of nuclear power generation by 2030, which will make India the third-largest producer of atomic energy in the world after the US and France. Singh said the credit for this rapid stride goes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi who took the decision of approving 10 reactors in a fleet mode in a single order and also allowed nuclear installations to be developed under joint ventures with PSUs. India has the sixth-highest number of functional nuclear reactors in the world and the second-highest number of reactors, including those under construction. During 2021-22, nuclear power reactors generated 47,112 million units of electricity, about 3.15 per cent of the total electricity generated in the country, Singh had told Lok Sabha last week. The present installed nuclear power capacity is set to increase from 6,780 megawatts (MW) to 22,480 MW by 2031 on progressive completion of projects under construction and accorded sanction, Singh had said.",

The British-Indian leader said the new Science and Technology Framework is designed to challenge every part of the government to better put the country at the forefront of global science and technology this decade through 10 key actions, creating a coordinated cross-government approach. Downing Street said the framework will work alongside a raft of new measures backed by over \u00a3370 million in funding to boost investment in innovation, bring the world's best talent to the UK, and seize the potential of ground-breaking new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI).  Trailblazing science and innovation have been in our DNA for decades. But in an increasingly competitive world, we can only stay ahead with focus, dynamism and leadership,  said Sunak.  That's why we're setting out 10 key actions under a bold new plan to cement our place as a global science and technology superpower by 2030 - from pursuing transformational technologies like AI and supercomputing to attracting top talent and ensuring they have the tools they need to succeed. The more we innovate, the more we can grow our economy, create the high-paid jobs of the future, protect our security, and improve lives across the country,  he said. The delivery of the new framework is set to begin immediately with an initial set of projects, which are estimated as being worth around \u00a3500 million in new and existing funding towards skills and infrastructure to help the UK take a global lead in  game-changing technologies .  Innovation and technology are our future. They hold the keys to everything from raising productivity and wages, to transforming healthcare, reducing energy prices and ultimately creating jobs and economic growth in the UK, providing the financial firepower allowing us to spend more on public services,  said Michelle Donelan, the new UK science, innovation and technology secretary. She added:  That is why, today, we are putting the full might of the British government and our private sector partners behind our push to become a scientific and technological superpower, because only through being world-leaders in future industries like AI and quantum will we be able to improve the lives of every Briton,  she said.

        "articleBody": "A Research team from Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati lhave developed a \u2018Recombinant Protein Toolbox\u2019 comprising of six special proteins, which can be used to convert healthy skin cells or any somatic cells from an adult human body into heart cells, specifically cardiomyocytes.The heart cells created using this toolbox can have the same function as the original heart cells and can be used to regenerate damaged heart tissues. Importantly, this toolbox can facilitate the generation of autologous heart cells in a lab. It is now well understood that a heart attack happens when a part of the heart is damaged. In some animals, like the Zebrafish, the heart can grow back after being damaged, but in humans, the heart usually gets scar tissue instead of growing back new heart cells. The only way to treat heart disease is with a new heart, but there aren't enough hearts available for transplantation, and it can be hard to make sure the new heart is accepted by the body. Scientists around the world are studying ways to convert regular body cells into heart cells, which could help with regenerating damaged hearts. The challenge is that cells can change in ways that could be harmful. So, scientists need to find a better, safer way to do this. Proteins produced from another source when applied can convert cells from one form to another in a process known as cellular reprogramming. This process involves the use of specific proteins, known as transcription factors, which can alter the expression of genes within a cell and direct it to take on a new cellular identity. The IIT Guwahati team has successfully produced cell-permeant recombinant proteins that can convert skin cells to heart cells. A recombinant protein is a desired protein produced by engineered host cells in a laboratory using recombinant DNA technology. By exposing skin cells to these proteins, the IIT Guwahati researchers could \u2018reprogram\u2019 the cells and make them have the characteristics of heart cells. This process can be seen as \u2018re-wiring\u2019 the genetic program of the skin cells to be more like that of heart cells. The team has collaborated with Dr Vishwas Kaveeshwar from the Central Research Laboratory at SDM College of Medical Sciences and Hospital in Dharwad, Karnataka, to validate the biological activity of the recombinant fusion proteins.Dr. Rajkumar P. Thummer, Assistant Professor, Department of Biosciences & Bioengineering, IIT Guwahati said, \u201cRecombinant protein-based cellular reprogramming is a promising alternative and the safest approach among other available non-integration approaches. As these proteins do not modify or alter the genome of the cells, the cells generated using this reprogramming approach have a high cell therapeutic value. Several challenges associated with the heterologous production of these recombinant proteins have been addressed in our six research publications in different journals.\u201d According to Krishna Kumar Haridhasapavalan, Research Scholar at IIT Guwahati, and first author of the papers published by the team, \u201cThe recombinant proteins can be delivered to target sites without the need of any harmful reagents. In addition to cardiac repair, these proteins can be studied for their role in various cancers as suppressors or promotors of tumour growth.\u201d The researchers have recently shared their results on the development of cell- and nucleus-penetrating versions of six cardiac reprogramming transcription factors in numerous international peer-reviewed journals including, Molecular Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, Bioprocess and Biosystems Engineering, Current Research in Biotechnology, Healthcare Research and Related Technologies Proceedings from NERC 2022, Scientific Reports, and Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology.",

        "articleBody": "City officials in New York have taken action to clear homeless individuals from the vicinity of the United Nations headquarters as preparations for the high-level General Assembly session get underway, with the aim of keeping them out of sight from visiting world leaders and enhancing security.The individuals, who have been residing in makeshift accommodations such as tarps, cardboard boxes, umbrellas, and construction sheds along First Avenue, the location of the UN, as well as Second Avenue and nearby streets, were evacuated by Sunday evening.This annual clearance operation reflects the ongoing challenges faced by the city, including a chronic housing crisis compounded by mental health issues, which place significant demands on the city's social services.In addition to the removal of homeless individuals, security measures for the UN event include the closure of many streets surrounding hotels where approximately 150 presidents and prime ministers will be lodging. These precautions not only serve security purposes but also shield VIPs from the sight of homelessness in the world's financial and media hub.While the removal of homeless individuals is linked to the UN event, New York City also periodically dismantles settlements established by impoverished residents.The responsibility of safeguarding the gathering of world leaders falls on the New York Police Department, which places an approximately 40-hectare area encompassing the UN headquarters under a virtual lockdown every September during the high-level meeting.During this period, those heading to the UN must pass through multiple security checkpoints manned by UN security personnel, police officers, and federal agents representing various agencies before reaching their destination. Residents and workers in the affected buildings are also subjected to heightened security measures.Overhead, police helicopters maintain surveillance, and police and Coast Guard boats patrol the East River behind the UN headquarters.The decision to implement riverine precautions was prompted by an incident in 1964 when anti-communist Cubans fired a bazooka at the UN from the opposite bank of the river while Fidel Castro's lieutenant, Che Guevara, was addressing the General Assembly. Fortunately, the attack missed its target.Although the recent removal of homeless individuals around the UN primarily serves security and cosmetic purposes, the city also periodically dismantles encampments established by its impoverished residents.Despite the city's obligation to provide proper housing for those displaced, an audit conducted by City Comptroller Brad Landler revealed that only three out of those forcibly removed from these sweeps received the promised hearing.As a result, the majority of individuals displaced in these operations, approximately 99.9%, remain homeless, according to Landler's statement to the National Public Radio network, a broadcaster that receives federal funding, in June.In 2022, reports indicate that over 1,500 encampments, each housing several individuals, were dismantled with the assistance of law enforcement.These encampments, often euphemistically referred to as settlements, consist of huts and tents set up on public or vacant land, under bridges, or overpasses by individuals experiencing poverty.",

        "articleBody": "Income Tax department raid on the Rampur residence in Uttar Pradesh of senior Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan continued for the third day on Friday.The department on Wednesday conducted searches at over 30 locations in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh as part of its tax evasion probe against Khan and people associated with him.Teams of IT personnel on Wednesday reached cities including Rampur, Meerut, Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Saharanpur and Sitapur to raid multiple premises linked to the Samajwadi Party leader.Searches were conducted on Thursday too at Khan's Rampur residence. Azam Khan was elected an MLA from the Rampur Sadar constituency. The state Assembly Secretariat, earlier in October, announced Khan's disqualification from the House after a court sentenced him to three years in jail in a hate speech case.The case was registered against Khan in April 2019 for levelling serious allegations against administrative officials posted in Rampur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath during an election meeting.During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Khan was booked for making inflammatory speeches while addressing a public meeting in Khatanagaria village of the Milak Kotwali area.Earlier, Allahabad High Court in May 2022 had granted interim bail to Azam Khan in a matter which was related to a wrongful possession of Waqf board property land. Azam Khan began his political career by winning the 1980 assembly election on Janata Party (Secular) ticket from Rampur. He has served as a minister in both Akhilesh Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav governments.As many as 81 cases have since been registered against the SP stalwart in Rampur on several charges including land grabbing, cheating, criminal trespass and hate speech.Khan's wife and ex-MP Tanzeen Fatima and their son and former MLA Abdullah Azam Khan have also been booked in at least 40 cases. All three are currently out on bail.Azam along with Tanzeen and Abdullah was arrested in February 2020 in a case of alleged forgery of the latter's birth certificate. Azam was released from jail in May 2022. Tanzeen was released from prison in December 2020 and Abdullah in January 2022. ",

Colonel Manpreet Singh, Commanding Officer of 19 Rashtriya Rifles, Major Ashish Dhonack, and Deputy Superintendent Humayun Bhat were killed in the gunfight with terrorists that ensued in Garol area of Anantnag district early Wednesday.  In a post on X, the Congress called the prime minister  insensitive  and shared videos of mourning family members of a deceased soldier and Prime Minister Modi being given a rousing welcome at the BJP headquarters on Wednesday evening following the successful G20 meeting under India's presidency.  In a post in Hindi on X, Congress media and publicity department head Pawan Khera said that at a time when the the sad news of the martyrdom of three officers of our army was coming, a  celebration was organized for Badshah  at the BJP headquarters.   No matter what happens, the Prime Minister cannot postpone receiving accolades,  he said.  Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said three officers of the police and the army were martyred in an encounter in Kashmir.   It breaks my heart to see pictures of their small children. And here the celebration hasn't stopped? He had not stopped shooting even after the martyrdom of 40 brave men in Pulwama. There is unimaginable insensitivity,  Shrinate said and shared pictures of the welcome at the BJP headquarters.  Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray faction) leader Priyanka Chaturvedi also shared the video of the rousing welcome accorded to the PM at the BJP headquarters, and said  this could have been postponed, expected more sensitivity, especially on a day when our security forces have fought a fierce fight with militants in Kashmir .  RJD leader Manoj Jha also slammed the BJP for organising the welcome programme for Prime Minister Modi and said the ruling party held  celebrations  at its headquarters even as three soldiers and a police officer were killed in a gunbattle with terrorists.   On a day when our Jawans were martyred, we were also watching celebrations at the BJP office. The nation was watching both visuals together,  Jha said.   At the time of Pulwama attack, they had said they got to know about it late... But this time they knew everything since morning. The ruling party and the Prime Minister were celebrating...

A team of 18 food safety officers has been diligently collecting samples of raw food items used in 19 five-star hotels located in New Delhi and the Aerocity area, specifically chosen to accommodate foreign guests during the summit. We conduct routine checks and sample collections, but given the significance of the G20 summit, we have deployed 18 food safety officers and initiated laboratory testing of the samples gathered from these hotels starting from Monday,  stated a senior department official.Scheduled to commence on September 9th, the two-day summit has already seen the arrival of several heads of state. A total of twenty-three five-star hotels have been designated for the dignitaries' stay, each subject to rigorous food safety scrutiny.The food safety officers are not limiting their inspection to just food items; they are also ensuring that kitchens and staff adhere to high standards of hygiene, including utensil cleaning. Furthermore, all cooked food will undergo meticulous monitoring and sampling for quality checks, conducted in collaboration with the local police.These food safety officers will inspect the cooking facilities and the procurement of raw food materials at various hotels. The raw food materials will only be used for cooking once the lab reports are obtained within 24 hours, as emphasized by the officer.No food items will be prepared or served in the hotel kitchens without undergoing a thorough lab test.Additionally, the food safety officers will maintain vigilance over the food served at banquets and other events associated with the summit. Typically, food sample reports take 15-20 days to arrive, but in this case, they will be expedited and made available within a few hours, the officer assured.Given the high-security environment surrounding the hotels where heads of state will reside, discussions and coordination have occurred with the city police regarding food item sampling. Police personnel have also been trained in the proper procedure for collecting samples of cooked food.This comprehensive approach extends to the sampling and testing of all food and beverages, including snacks and tea, to be served during banquets, high tea, breakfast, lunch, and dinner throughout the summit. The commitment of the Delhi Food Safety Department underscores the importance of ensuring the highest standards of food safety for the esteemed guests of the G20 summit.",

        "articleBody": "The Railway Board has directed the zonal railways to expeditiously dispose of pending requests of employees for transfer to the station or place of posting of their respective spouses. The communication to the principal chief personnel officers of 15 zones on August 17 came after the board received a number of representations from railway employees and their associations about delays or denial on their spouse ground transfer requests despite having a laid down policy.   It is requested that all such pending requests may be examined and disposed of in terms of laid down policy,  the letter stated, adding that the respective zones should apprise the board a summary of all pending and cleared requests along with reasons for the delay.  The board is of the view that after the digitisation process of Human Resource Management System (HRMS), such requests should not be pending for long.  On August 20 last year, the board issued a similar direction asking for  information pertaining to disposal of requests of transfer on spouse ground .  After coming to know that there were several spouse ground transfer requests pending, it directed the zones on September 6 last year to launch a special drive to dispose of all cases.  In its latest communication, the board has reiterated its direction and asked zones to bring to conclusion all new and old pending cases.  In March 2, 2010, the Ministry of Railways relaxed its policy of posting husband and wife at the same station keeping in view the need  to make concerted efforts to increase representation of women in central government jobs .  The policy took into consideration various working conditions such as the seniority status of husband and wife, employment status where one of the spouses may belong to another central service etc and suggested transfer options accordingly.  Several such spouses working at different stations claim that they deserve to be posted at the same place as per the laid down norms, but the departments concerned have kept their transfer requests on hold without any valid reason. Some of them have alleged that their transfer requests were denied without any valid reason.  On August 19 this year, the All India Train Controllers' Association wrote a letter to the principal chief operation manager of the Northern Railway alleging wrongful denial of spouse ground transfer requests of train controllers.   I would like to bring it to your notice that misinterpretation of Railway Board's guidelines by Personnel Department has caused trouble for train controllers who are desirous of inter-divisional/zonal transfer on reasonable and permitted grounds,  the officer-bearers of the association said in its letter.  Senior officers in the board are of the view that immediate disposal of such transfers help enable employees to lead a normal family life.",

        "articleBody": "The Centre will launch a mega campaign in November to promote the submission of digital life certificate by pensioners, an official statement issued on Wednesday said. Submission of life certificates is an important activity to be carried out by pensioners every year in the month of November (with a special provision for pensioners aged 80 years and above to submit them in October) to ensure the continuity of their pension.  To enhance the 'ease of living' of central government pensioners, the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has been promoting digital life certificate (DLC) i.e. 'Jeevan Pramaan' extensively, it said.   With a view to spread awareness amongst all the central government pensioners as well as the pension disbursing authorities for the use of DLC/face authentication technology to submit digital life certificates, DoPPW launched a nationwide campaign in November 2022 in 37 cities throughout the country. The campaign was a huge success with more than 35 lakh DLCs of central government pensioners issued,  said the statement issued by the Personnel Ministry.  A similar campaign will now be held from November 1 to 30, 2023 in 100 cities across the country, targeting 50 lakh pensioners, it said.   To ensure the success of the campaign, so that the benefit of digital modes of life certificate submission reaches pensioners in the remotest corners of the country and also benefits super senior/sick /incapacitated pensioners, a comprehensive circular with detailed guidelines has been issued defining roles and responsibilities of all the stakeholders which includes ministries/ departments of the government of India, pension disbursing banks and pensioners' associations,  the statement said.  These guidelines include nomination of nodal officers by the stakeholders, for the campaign, spreading awareness/providing due publicity to DLC-face authentication technique through banners/posters placed strategically in offices and bank branches/ ATMs and equipping dedicated staff at bank branches with an Android phone to use this technology when pensioners visit the branch for submission of life certificate, it said.  The guidelines also mention holding camps to enable pensioners to submit their DLCs without delay and home visits in case of bedridden pensioners, the statement said.   In addition, pensioners' welfare associations have been sensitised to hold camps for pensioners for DLC submission. Teams from the department will also be visiting various locations throughout the country to assist pensioners in the use of various digital modes to submit their life certificates. Due publicity will be given through social media using Twitter, Facebook and videos on YouTube,  it added.  As per the face authentication facility, the identity of a person is established through the face recognition technique and DLC gets generated.   This breakthrough technology, launched in November 2021, reduced the dependence of pensioners on external biometric devices and made the process more accessible and affordable to masses by leveraging smartphone-based technology,  the statement said.",

        "articleBody": "Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Monday said that almost 2,000 promotions in Assistant Section Officer (ASO) and other grades are in process and are likely to be completed by this year-end. He stated this while meeting a delegation of central secretariat employees, including representatives of the Central Secretariat Service (CSS) forum and direct recruits of limited departmental competitive examination (LDCE), who had jointly called on the minister.  Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel, said that last year alone about 9,000 mass promotions were made and, prior to that, the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) granted 4,000 promotions in three years.  The minister said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is very keen that hardworking and performing officials should be provided with a work-friendly environment as well as timely service benefits so that they remain motivated to give in their best for nation-building.   The government led by Prime Minister Modi has been granting mass promotions to employees in order to motivate them and overcome the problem of long stagnation. Another 2,000 promotions in ASO and other grades are in process and hopefully, they will get promoted by this year-end,  Singh was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the Personnel Ministry.  The DoPT had last month approved the mass promotion of 1,592 officials working in the capacity of ASOs to the post of Section Officers (SOs) on an adhoc basis with immediate effect.  The minister said that in the last nine years, under the guidance of Prime Minister Modi, the government has periodically reviewed the longstanding stagnation issues in the various central ministries that are a legacy of the past due to pending court cases, lack of vacancies in higher grades and other personnel issues.  Singh said the government is concerned about long stagnation in certain cadres and at certain levels where some of the employees working in the lowest rung of the administration spend their entire service tenure of 30 to 35 years without getting a single promotion.  Singh regretted that in a large number of cases, stagnation in promotions was the result of litigations prompted by inappropriate decisions or twisting of rules to give out-of-turn promotions during the previous governments, the statement said.  In few of the 4,000 promotions cleared in recent years, the government granted promotions despite the cases being sub-judice, after consulting legal experts and making valid provisions for judicial scrutiny, he said.",

This annual clearance operation highlights the city's ongoing challenges with homelessness and mental health issues. In addition to the removal of homeless individuals, security measures for the UN event include street closures around hotels where leaders will be staying. ",

        "articleBody": "City officials in New York have taken action to clear homeless individuals from the vicinity of the United Nations headquarters as preparations for the high-level General Assembly session get underway, with the aim of keeping them out of sight from visiting world leaders and enhancing security.The individuals, who have been residing in makeshift accommodations such as tarps, cardboard boxes, umbrellas, and construction sheds along First Avenue, the location of the UN, as well as Second Avenue and nearby streets, were evacuated by Sunday evening.This annual clearance operation reflects the ongoing challenges faced by the city, including a chronic housing crisis compounded by mental health issues, which place significant demands on the city's social services.In addition to the removal of homeless individuals, security measures for the UN event include the closure of many streets surrounding hotels where approximately 150 presidents and prime ministers will be lodging. These precautions not only serve security purposes but also shield VIPs from the sight of homelessness in the world's financial and media hub.While the removal of homeless individuals is linked to the UN event, New York City also periodically dismantles settlements established by impoverished residents.The responsibility of safeguarding the gathering of world leaders falls on the New York Police Department, which places an approximately 40-hectare area encompassing the UN headquarters under a virtual lockdown every September during the high-level meeting.During this period, those heading to the UN must pass through multiple security checkpoints manned by UN security personnel, police officers, and federal agents representing various agencies before reaching their destination. Residents and workers in the affected buildings are also subjected to heightened security measures.Overhead, police helicopters maintain surveillance, and police and Coast Guard boats patrol the East River behind the UN headquarters.The decision to implement riverine precautions was prompted by an incident in 1964 when anti-communist Cubans fired a bazooka at the UN from the opposite bank of the river while Fidel Castro's lieutenant, Che Guevara, was addressing the General Assembly. Fortunately, the attack missed its target.Although the recent removal of homeless individuals around the UN primarily serves security and cosmetic purposes, the city also periodically dismantles encampments established by its impoverished residents.Despite the city's obligation to provide proper housing for those displaced, an audit conducted by City Comptroller Brad Landler revealed that only three out of those forcibly removed from these sweeps received the promised hearing.As a result, the majority of individuals displaced in these operations, approximately 99.9%, remain homeless, according to Landler's statement to the National Public Radio network, a broadcaster that receives federal funding, in June.In 2022, reports indicate that over 1,500 encampments, each housing several individuals, were dismantled with the assistance of law enforcement.These encampments, often euphemistically referred to as settlements, consist of huts and tents set up on public or vacant land, under bridges, or overpasses by individuals experiencing poverty.",

Azam Khan was elected an MLA from the Rampur Sadar constituency. The state Assembly Secretariat, earlier in October, announced Khan's disqualification from the House after a court sentenced him to three years in jail in a hate speech case.The case was registered against Khan in April 2019 for levelling serious allegations against administrative officials posted in Rampur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath during an election meeting.During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Khan was booked for making inflammatory speeches while addressing a public meeting in Khatanagaria village of the Milak Kotwali area.Earlier, Allahabad High Court in May 2022 had granted interim bail to Azam Khan in a matter which was related to a wrongful possession of Waqf board property land. Azam Khan began his political career by winning the 1980 assembly election on Janata Party (Secular) ticket from Rampur. He has served as a minister in both Akhilesh Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav governments.As many as 81 cases have since been registered against the SP stalwart in Rampur on several charges including land grabbing, cheating, criminal trespass and hate speech.Khan's wife and ex-MP Tanzeen Fatima and their son and former MLA Abdullah Azam Khan have also been booked in at least 40 cases. All three are currently out on bail.Azam along with Tanzeen and Abdullah was arrested in February 2020 in a case of alleged forgery of the latter's birth certificate. Azam was released from jail in May 2022. Tanzeen was released from prison in December 2020 and Abdullah in January 2022. ",

A team of 18 food safety officers has been diligently collecting samples of raw food items used in 19 five-star hotels located in New Delhi and the Aerocity area, specifically chosen to accommodate foreign guests during the summit. We conduct routine checks and sample collections, but given the significance of the G20 summit, we have deployed 18 food safety officers and initiated laboratory testing of the samples gathered from these hotels starting from Monday,  stated a senior department official.Scheduled to commence on September 9th, the two-day summit has already seen the arrival of several heads of state. A total of twenty-three five-star hotels have been designated for the dignitaries' stay, each subject to rigorous food safety scrutiny.The food safety officers are not limiting their inspection to just food items; they are also ensuring that kitchens and staff adhere to high standards of hygiene, including utensil cleaning. Furthermore, all cooked food will undergo meticulous monitoring and sampling for quality checks, conducted in collaboration with the local police.These food safety officers will inspect the cooking facilities and the procurement of raw food materials at various hotels. The raw food materials will only be used for cooking once the lab reports are obtained within 24 hours, as emphasized by the officer.No food items will be prepared or served in the hotel kitchens without undergoing a thorough lab test.Additionally, the food safety officers will maintain vigilance over the food served at banquets and other events associated with the summit. Typically, food sample reports take 15-20 days to arrive, but in this case, they will be expedited and made available within a few hours, the officer assured.Given the high-security environment surrounding the hotels where heads of state will reside, discussions and coordination have occurred with the city police regarding food item sampling. Police personnel have also been trained in the proper procedure for collecting samples of cooked food.This comprehensive approach extends to the sampling and testing of all food and beverages, including snacks and tea, to be served during banquets, high tea, breakfast, lunch, and dinner throughout the summit. The commitment of the Delhi Food Safety Department underscores the importance of ensuring the highest standards of food safety for the esteemed guests of the G20 summit.",

The five government hospitals that have been put on  high alert  are Lok Nayak Hospital, GB Pant Hospital, GTB Hospital, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital and Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital, while the private ones are Primus Hospital-Chanakyapuri, Max Hospital-Saket and Manipal Hospital-Dwarka, they said. The private hospitals have been selected by taking into account of their proximity to the hotels where guests would be staying, the officials said. A state-of-the-art medical emergency facility with ICU services has also been set up within the premises of the Bharat Mandapam. Sources added that adequate arrangements have also been made at the Ram Mahohar Lohia Hospital and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in view of the summit. The officials said other government and private hospitals have also been directed to make arrangements to deal with any emergency. The Delhi Police has also made arrangements to provide assistance to medical emergency vehicles. An Ambulance Assistance Control Room will be operational from the intervening night of September 7 and September 8 to September 11 on the number 6828400604 and 112, according to a senior official.  During this period, traffic police personnel will remain present in control rooms of the Centralized Accident and Trauma Services (CATS), Directorate of Health Services (DHS), major government and private hospitals. Apart from this, medical emergency vehicle assistance teams will be deployed at major junctions across the city,  he added.

In an interview with PTI Video, Garg said the department is geared up to combat any fire-related situation during the summit.  The DFS has also procured four special high-voltage water pumping machines to avoid any waterlogging in the Rajghat area if it rains, he said.   Every department is preparing for the upcoming G20 meet. DFS is considered one of the most prominent departments, and the department has prepared itself to tackle any fire incident that may take place,  Garg told PTI.  Sharing about the action plan, the senior official said they have divided the summit area into three prominent parts for deployment.   First will be the meeting venue Bharat Mandapam, where all the delegates will gather for the meeting. The second area is where all dignitaries will stay (mostly all the prominent hotels of the city). And the third part includes the tourists' places where all dignitaries will visit,  Garg further said.  He further said DFS have deployed 35 fire tenders for the G20 duties and a total of 500 people are assigned for the same.   During the G20 Summit, all the holidays of the employees have been cancelled and they will be ready with advance and new equipment. We have chalked out a proper plan so that we will also provide immediate help and respond to routine calls as well. We almost receive 100 fire calls in a day, we will manage them as well,  he added.  The DFS had been conducting mock drills by the crew who are part of the assignment for a better understanding of how they will immediately take charge of any condition.  There will be six to seven members in every unit.  Units will be deployed at key locations and they will be prepared for any situation. From Delhi airport to every important location, we have also decided that these units will not be carrying out any bird rescue exercise,  he added.",

The board received numerous complaints from railway employees and their associations regarding delays or denials of spouse ground transfer requests, despite having a policy in place. ",

        "articleBody": "The Railway Board has directed the zonal railways to expeditiously dispose of pending requests of employees for transfer to the station or place of posting of their respective spouses. The communication to the principal chief personnel officers of 15 zones on August 17 came after the board received a number of representations from railway employees and their associations about delays or denial on their spouse ground transfer requests despite having a laid down policy.   It is requested that all such pending requests may be examined and disposed of in terms of laid down policy,  the letter stated, adding that the respective zones should apprise the board a summary of all pending and cleared requests along with reasons for the delay.  The board is of the view that after the digitisation process of Human Resource Management System (HRMS), such requests should not be pending for long.  On August 20 last year, the board issued a similar direction asking for  information pertaining to disposal of requests of transfer on spouse ground .  After coming to know that there were several spouse ground transfer requests pending, it directed the zones on September 6 last year to launch a special drive to dispose of all cases.  In its latest communication, the board has reiterated its direction and asked zones to bring to conclusion all new and old pending cases.  In March 2, 2010, the Ministry of Railways relaxed its policy of posting husband and wife at the same station keeping in view the need  to make concerted efforts to increase representation of women in central government jobs .  The policy took into consideration various working conditions such as the seniority status of husband and wife, employment status where one of the spouses may belong to another central service etc and suggested transfer options accordingly.  Several such spouses working at different stations claim that they deserve to be posted at the same place as per the laid down norms, but the departments concerned have kept their transfer requests on hold without any valid reason. Some of them have alleged that their transfer requests were denied without any valid reason.  On August 19 this year, the All India Train Controllers' Association wrote a letter to the principal chief operation manager of the Northern Railway alleging wrongful denial of spouse ground transfer requests of train controllers.   I would like to bring it to your notice that misinterpretation of Railway Board's guidelines by Personnel Department has caused trouble for train controllers who are desirous of inter-divisional/zonal transfer on reasonable and permitted grounds,  the officer-bearers of the association said in its letter.  Senior officers in the board are of the view that immediate disposal of such transfers help enable employees to lead a normal family life.",

        "articleBody": "The Centre will launch a mega campaign in November to promote the submission of digital life certificate by pensioners, an official statement issued on Wednesday said. Submission of life certificates is an important activity to be carried out by pensioners every year in the month of November (with a special provision for pensioners aged 80 years and above to submit them in October) to ensure the continuity of their pension.  To enhance the 'ease of living' of central government pensioners, the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has been promoting digital life certificate (DLC) i.e. 'Jeevan Pramaan' extensively, it said.   With a view to spread awareness amongst all the central government pensioners as well as the pension disbursing authorities for the use of DLC/face authentication technology to submit digital life certificates, DoPPW launched a nationwide campaign in November 2022 in 37 cities throughout the country. The campaign was a huge success with more than 35 lakh DLCs of central government pensioners issued,  said the statement issued by the Personnel Ministry.  A similar campaign will now be held from November 1 to 30, 2023 in 100 cities across the country, targeting 50 lakh pensioners, it said.   To ensure the success of the campaign, so that the benefit of digital modes of life certificate submission reaches pensioners in the remotest corners of the country and also benefits super senior/sick /incapacitated pensioners, a comprehensive circular with detailed guidelines has been issued defining roles and responsibilities of all the stakeholders which includes ministries/ departments of the government of India, pension disbursing banks and pensioners' associations,  the statement said.  These guidelines include nomination of nodal officers by the stakeholders, for the campaign, spreading awareness/providing due publicity to DLC-face authentication technique through banners/posters placed strategically in offices and bank branches/ ATMs and equipping dedicated staff at bank branches with an Android phone to use this technology when pensioners visit the branch for submission of life certificate, it said.  The guidelines also mention holding camps to enable pensioners to submit their DLCs without delay and home visits in case of bedridden pensioners, the statement said.   In addition, pensioners' welfare associations have been sensitised to hold camps for pensioners for DLC submission. Teams from the department will also be visiting various locations throughout the country to assist pensioners in the use of various digital modes to submit their life certificates. Due publicity will be given through social media using Twitter, Facebook and videos on YouTube,  it added.  As per the face authentication facility, the identity of a person is established through the face recognition technique and DLC gets generated.   This breakthrough technology, launched in November 2021, reduced the dependence of pensioners on external biometric devices and made the process more accessible and affordable to masses by leveraging smartphone-based technology,  the statement said.",

        "articleBody": "Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Monday said that almost 2,000 promotions in Assistant Section Officer (ASO) and other grades are in process and are likely to be completed by this year-end. He stated this while meeting a delegation of central secretariat employees, including representatives of the Central Secretariat Service (CSS) forum and direct recruits of limited departmental competitive examination (LDCE), who had jointly called on the minister.  Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel, said that last year alone about 9,000 mass promotions were made and, prior to that, the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) granted 4,000 promotions in three years.  The minister said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is very keen that hardworking and performing officials should be provided with a work-friendly environment as well as timely service benefits so that they remain motivated to give in their best for nation-building.   The government led by Prime Minister Modi has been granting mass promotions to employees in order to motivate them and overcome the problem of long stagnation. Another 2,000 promotions in ASO and other grades are in process and hopefully, they will get promoted by this year-end,  Singh was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the Personnel Ministry.  The DoPT had last month approved the mass promotion of 1,592 officials working in the capacity of ASOs to the post of Section Officers (SOs) on an adhoc basis with immediate effect.  The minister said that in the last nine years, under the guidance of Prime Minister Modi, the government has periodically reviewed the longstanding stagnation issues in the various central ministries that are a legacy of the past due to pending court cases, lack of vacancies in higher grades and other personnel issues.  Singh said the government is concerned about long stagnation in certain cadres and at certain levels where some of the employees working in the lowest rung of the administration spend their entire service tenure of 30 to 35 years without getting a single promotion.  Singh regretted that in a large number of cases, stagnation in promotions was the result of litigations prompted by inappropriate decisions or twisting of rules to give out-of-turn promotions during the previous governments, the statement said.  In few of the 4,000 promotions cleared in recent years, the government granted promotions despite the cases being sub-judice, after consulting legal experts and making valid provisions for judicial scrutiny, he said.",

He also informed members about CPENGRAMS (Centralised Pension Grievances Redress And Monitoring System), an online grievance registration portal of the department. Srinivas talked about stronger collaboration with banks who are committed towards providing comfort to pensioners through timely and correct payment of pension. Sanjiv Narain Mathur shared the initiative of the department related to holding of a nationwide DLC campaign to reach out to pensioners in the remotest corners, with special emphasis on hospitalised and incapacitated pensioners.

There was waterlogging since the morning hours, which resulted in traffic snarls across the city, and the Traffic Control room received complaints regarding congestion, uprooting of trees, potholes and signals not working, according to officials. Police personnel were deployed at intersections where signals were not working, they said and added that data collected by the traffic police showed that there were potholes at four major locations -- Bagga roundabout, on Ambedkar Road, Rail Bhawan to Windsor Place on Raisina Road and Adhchini on Aurobindo Marg. They said power failure resulted in signals not working. Trees were uprooted at six locations -- Kishanganj Railway Colony, Tara Chand Mathur Marg, Ajmeri Gate, 12, Janpath, Khan Market and Madarsa to JLN Marg, the officials said.  Trees were removed along footpaths and central verges and traffic movement was managed in best possible manner. The operations at some locations are still going on and services of other departments are also being taken,  a senior traffic official said. According to the data, as at 4.40 pm, traffic congestion was witnessed at 54 locations of Delhi due to various reasons. These included roads in Geeta Colony, Mangolpuri Industrial Area, West Vinod Nagar, East Vinod Nagar, Adhchini traffic signal, Chilla Border, Azad Market, Mundka, Rajdhani Park, Nawab Ganj, Sant Nagar, Burari, Sarai Kale Khan, Nehru Vihar Crossing, Nigam Bodh Ghat, Paschim Vihar and Okhla Subzi Mandi. Around  3,450 traffic police personnel were deployed who regulated the traffic in entire Delhi wearing rain coats and boots , the traffic department said.  Messages through Traffic Control Room were also flashed to control rooms of other civic agencies like Horticulture Departments of NDMC, PWD, MCD, etc. They were also pressed into for using local resources, manpower and attending to the situation and calls with due alertness, alacrity and promptness,  the traffic department said. For traffic management, deputy and assistant commissioners of police and inspectors were directed to mobilise personnel, patrol teams and cranes to remove broken branches, uprooted trees and stalled vehicles. Traffic congestion and waterlogging were also reported in parts Maharani Bagh Bus Stand, Nangloi Flyover, Mathura Road, Ring Road, Kapashera Chowk, Sarita Vihar, Bhairon Marg, JLN Stadium, Pragati Maidan, Civil Lines, Motilal Nehru Marg, Sunehri Bagh, Central Secretariat, Teen Murti, Satya Niketan, Chanakyapuri and RML hospital, the data showed.",

The minister said, even legal experts were consulted as some of the orders are subject to the outcome of pending writ petitions.",
        "datePublished": "2023-06-27T18:49:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "The Centre has approved the mass promotion of 1,592 assistant section officers to the post of section officers with immediate effect, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Tuesday. He said that the promotion orders will be issued soon by the respective cadre controlling authorities.  Government has been granting mass promotions to employees to motivate them and overcome the problem of long stagnation. Another 2,000 promotions in ASO and other grades are in process and hopefully, they will get promoted by this year's end,  said Singh, the minister of state for personnel. The move assumes significance as the Central Secretariat Service (CSS) officers' association had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his intervention to ensure the promotion of ASOs to the grade of Section Officers.  The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), Ministry of Personnel, has approved the mass promotion of 1,592 officials working in the capacity of ASOs to the post of section officers on an ad-hoc basis with immediate effect,  Singh said. He said in the last nine years, under the guidance of Modi, the government has periodically reviewed the longstanding stagnation issues in various central ministries that are a legacy of the past due to pending court cases, lack of vacancies in higher grades and other personnel issues. The minister said, last year also about 9,000 mass promotions were made and before that, the DoPT granted 4,000 promotions in the preceding three years. Singh said he personally feels disturbed to come across cases where some of the employees working in the lowest rung of the administration spend their entire service tenure of 30 to 35 years without securing a single promotion. The minister said he has discussed the issue with all the senior officers in the personnel ministry and several innovative means have been evolved to avoid stagnation at the middle and lower rungs of the administration. Singh also regretted that in a large number of cases, stagnation in promotions was the result of litigation amongst the employees themselves and even though the DoPT tries its best to put forward its view in the court of law, the delay becomes inevitable, according to a personnel ministry statement.  PM Modi has made efforts to ensure that government jobs are available to the maximum extent possible. It is extremely painful and disheartening to see employees sometimes superannuating in the same grade as promotions remained stuck,  he added. The orders for mass promotion of these employees belonging to the CSS have been issued after several rounds of high-level meetings in the DoPT chaired by Singh in the last few months, the statement said. The minister said, even legal experts were consulted as some of the orders are subject to the outcome of pending writ petitions. To bring in the ease of governance as well as objectivity in empanelment, the government has, in the last nine years, improvised upon the procedures to ensure that there are no subjective preferences involved in carrying out the promotions.  Procedures have been made more hi-tech using sophisticated technology tools to minimise the human interface,  he added. Singh said that the Modi government has done away with more than 1,600 rules which were either obsolete or had become irrelevant with time.  All this is meant not only to ensure effective and timely delivery of outcomes for the public but also to enable the employees to perform to the best of their ability,  the minister said.",

A systematic attempt is being made to change the character of the civil services, particularly the IAS and the IPS, which, in our constitutional scheme, were uniquely intended to be a protective ring around the Constitution, unaffected by political changes, having an all-India perspective rather than a regional, parochial one and being secure enough to maintain an independent, nonpartisan outlook, without fear or favour, the letter said.",

        "articleBody": "Highlighting lateral recruitment and proposed changes in civil services deputation rules, a group of 82 former civil servants on Thursday wrote to President Droupadi Murmu raising concern over  systematic attempts  being made to change the character of civil services. In an open letter, they appealed to her to convey their concerns to the Union government and caution them that the attempt to change the character of the civil services is fraught with extreme danger and will  spell the death of the constitutional government in India . A systematic attempt is being made to change the character of the civil services, particularly the IAS and the IPS, which, in our constitutional scheme, were uniquely intended to be a protective ring around the Constitution, unaffected by political changes, having an all-India perspective rather than a regional, parochial one and being secure enough to maintain an independent, nonpartisan outlook, without fear or favour, the letter said.  It is in this context that we seek to approach you on a matter which, of late, is causing much concern to us and which we are duty bound to bring to your notice,  it said. Service rules are sought to be amended to compel central deputations without the consent of either the officers concerned or their state governments, effectively undermining the authority and control of chief ministers over their officers, the letter said.  This has disturbed the federal balance and left civil servants torn between conflicting loyalties, thereby weakening their ability to be impartial,  it read. The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) had in December 2021 proposed changes to the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954, that will take away the power of states to override the Centre's request for seeking the officers on central deputation, and had sought comments from the states and Union Territories on it. The existing rules allow mutual consultation over the central deputation of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers. No final decision has been taken yet in the matter. In the past, governments have permitted lateral recruitment at senior levels and many such officers have distinguished themselves, the letter said. Lately, however, there has been opacity in the recruitment process at mid-levels and concerns that candidates are being chosen based on their ideological predilections, it said. The consequences of this for the future of an independent civil service requires no comment, the letter said. The Centre has this month decided to recruit 20 private sector specialists as joint secretaries, directors, and deputy secretaries on contract basis in its 12 departments. The former bureaucrats said measures are being taken that threaten the unique federal design of the IAS and the IPS, which underlies Sardar Patel's vision of a permanent civil service that would both bind the country together and enable it to maintain a balance between the interests of the Union and the states.  There are noticeable attempts to pressure officers to show exclusive loyalty to the Union rather than to the parent state cadre to which they are allotted,  the letter said. On occasions, arbitrary departmental actions have been taken against those who refuse to do so, it alleged. Former foreign secretary Sujatha Singh, ex-UPSC member Parveen Talha, former IPS officer Maxwell Pereira and ex- social justice empowerment secretary Anita Agnihotri are among the 82 signatories to the letter.  The actions and words of some very senior functionaries of the central government increases our concern on the future of the civil service and the consequent danger to democracy in India,  the letter said.  In this context, we would like to mention that the National Security Advisor (NSA), while addressing IPS officers at their passing out function in 2021, had emphasised that they should treat civil society as the 'fourth generation of warfare, that can be subverted, suborned, divided and manipulated to hurt the interests of the nation',  it said. Such sentiments are  antithetical to any democratic dispensation  and aim at placing civil society in a position of conflict with the state, the letter claimed.  At a time when politics is leaning dangerously towards a centralised, authoritarian, national security state with a leadership seemingly amenable to abandoning, without demur, the fundamental principles on which our Constitution is based, it has become critical for citizens to ensure that institutions and systems like the civil services which can check this frightening erosion of constitutional values in the manner envisaged by the great Sardar are protected and strengthened,  the letter said. By virtue of their allegiance to the Constitution and not the government of the day, the all-India services, particularly the IAS and IPS, have a critical role to play, it said.  As the constitutional head of the republic, we appeal to you to convey our concerns to the Union government and caution them that this attempt to change the character of the civil services is fraught with extreme danger and, as Sardar Patel had warned many years ago, will spell the death of constitutional government in India,  it added.",

The breach hit systems for processing TRANServe transit benefits that reimburse government employees for some commuting costs. It was not clear if any of the personal information had been used for criminal purposes. USDOT notified Congress Friday in an email seen by Reuters that its initial investigation of the data breach has  isolated the breach to certain systems at the department used for administrative functions, such as employee transit benefits processing.   USDOT said in a statement to Reuters the breach did not affect any transportation safety systems. It did not say who might be responsible for the hack.  The department is investigating the breach and has frozen access to the transit benefit system until it has been secured and restored, it said.  The maximum benefit allowance is $280 per month for federal employee mass transit commuting costs. The breach impacted 114,000 current employees and 123,000 former employees. Federal employees and agencies have been target of hackers in the past. Two breaches at the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in 2014 and 2015 compromised sensitive data belonging to more than 22 million people, including 4.2 million current and federal employees along with fingerprint data of 5.6 million of those individuals. Suspected Russian hackers who used SolarWinds and Microsoft software to burrow into US federal agencies breached unclassified Justice Department networks and read emails at the Treasury, Commerce and Homeland Security departments. Nine federal agencies were breached, Reuters reported in 2021.  (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chris Reese, Cynthia Osterman and Diane Craft)",

Singh was addressing the press on the sidelines of the Pune-based Armed Forces Medical College's (AFMC)'s Platinum Jubilee celebrations. It is an ongoing process in which blood samples are being collected in a graded manner for archiving in the repository that is maintained at AFMC's Department of Forensic Medicine, he said.  What does DNA profiling mean? You take a drop of the blood of an individual, put it on a special filter paper, and store it in a repository. Later, if you want to identify that individual for some reason, such as an unfortunate accident, we can retrieve his sample from the repository and match it with the DNA recovered from the mortal remains,  Lt General Singh explained.  Dried blood spots on specialized filter paper of individuals (armed forces personnel) are stored in the Forensic Department at AFMC. So far, in 12 cases, mortal remains have been identified using this technology, including those who died in the crash of a helicopter carrying (CDS) General Bipin Rawat,  he said. Rawat was killed along with 13 others, including his wife, in a helicopter crash in Tamil Nadu's Nilgiris area on December 8. 2021. Speaking about the 'Doctor Pilot' project, Singh said the aim of the programme is for doctors to understand the problems faced by the pilots.  Previously, doctors would have proper training and become pilots, and now with this project being resurrected, they will continue (to receive the proper training ),  he said, adding the programme was stopped, but now, in a systematic way, it would be restarted.  As of now, two doctors each in the fighter, helicopter, and transport streams will be trained. Based on the feedback, the project it will evolve further,  Singh said. Addressing queries related to the preparedness of the AFMS for a possible resurgence of COVID-19, the DGAFMS said military hospitals are fully prepared with adequate manpower and equipment for such a situation. Singh asserted the AFMC will be accorded status of Institute of National Importance in the coming years. The Platinum Jubilee celebrations were attended by high-ranking officers and civilian dignitaries from across the country, with eminent medical professionals sharing their expertise through orations, panel discussions, and symposiums. Among the highlights was a panel discussion on 'Contributions of Alumni to AFMC and the way forward', which was held in hybrid mode, with panelists and participants from across the globe. The two-day event was successfully conducted under the guidance and patronage of Lt Gen Narendra Kotwal, Director and Commandant of AFMC, a defence release said. On the occasion, a 108-foot Tricolour was hoisted by Flag Foundation of India in the presence of its founder and former MP Naveen Jindal.",

        "description": "Government jobs in India have been the most preferred option for decades, considering their job security, improved pay structure, work-life balance, housing, medical benefits, and post-retirement benefits. The increased demand for these jobs is strikingly contrasted by the limited opportunities. Moreover, the increasing obsession with government jobs results in challenges, including long wait periods and huge competition for limited job openings. ",

        "articleBody": "\u201cEk bar sarkari naukri lag jaye beta, fir life set ho jayegi tumhari (Child, your life would be easier once you get a government job)\u201d. We all must have heard our parents express this opinion at some point in time, right? Some students might have joined a coaching centre during college days to prepare for entrance exams to a public sector job. For decades, government jobs have been acknowledged as the most comfortable and secure employment option . In addition, their popularity has increased in the current fiercely competitive employment sector.According to a report by the Department of Personnel and Training, over 22 crore applicants have applied for government jobs since 2014, and over 7.22 lakh have received permanent positions in the central government. These numbers also highlight the contrast between the limited number of seats available and the consistently increasing demand for these jobs. However, it\u2019s important to note that the campaigns and initiatives launched by the government \u2014 such as the Make in India scheme and the production-linked incentive schemes \u2014 aim to bridge this gap by generating more than 60 lakh jobs. So, what makes government jobs so alluring? Job security and stability \u2013 While layoffs are common in the private sector, job security is considered a big benefit in public sector jobs. In addition, businesses sometimes merge and in some rare cases even collapse, leading to potential job issues for many. This is not the case in public sector jobs.Improved pay structure \u2013 Another significant reason to consider is the pay structure. After the introduction of the 7th Pay Commission\u2019s recommendations, the salary a government employee gets, along with allowances \u2014 such as travel allowance, dearness allowance, children's education allowance and rent \u2014 actually make their jobs even more rewarding. Work hours and balance \u2013 Work hours are considered stable in most public sector jobs. However, it also depends on the role and responsibility. For instance, if you are interested in joining the police force, armed forces or the railways, you will have to abide by the work timings required to fulfil your responsibility. During the pandemic, we saw government healthcare practitioners and policemen function day and night, to help and support citizens. Housing and medical benefits \u2013 Some staff get quarters and that can help save money that can be invested elsewhere. In many cases, government employees are entitled to free treatment, medicines, consultations and hospitalisation, sometimes even at renowned hospitals. Many of these premium facilities are offered to their families also.Post-retirement benefits \u2013 Pension is another key benefit that attract people to government jobs. The amount paid as pension varies depending on factors such as your designation, the number of years you have worked and your pay during the last five years. In addition, retirement benefits like provident fund, gratuity and salary arrears help in attaining financial independence after retirement.Nation building - In some government jobs \u2014 such as the army, police, public administration or in enabling technology for citizen access \u2014 there is an associated pride and happiness in serving and helping the nation move forward. Many find this inspiring.But, the increasing obsession with government jobs is also a challenge. How?In India, some youngsters are obsessed with the idea of securing their life with a \u201csarkari naukri\u201d. Thousands of young people appear for central and state exams every year. It is not easy to pass these competitive exams with flying colours in the first attempt. Many spend years and years studying for these exams in the hope of passing them the next time.There have been reports of government job aspirants clearing the entrance exams but not receiving joining letters. Youngsters in many states wait till they can get a government job. This gets linked to the unemployment figures. According to the unemployment report published by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, the rate of unemployment for those in the age bracket of 20-24 stood at 41.9% in September 2022; it was 9.8% for those in the 25-29 years category. Yes, government jobs do offer safety and have other attractions. However, it should not become an obsession and lead to more unemployment. So, you need to move forward with a rational mindset and do what\u2019s best for your career growth. Experts recommend seeking professional career guidance to set yourself in the right direction.",

        "articleBody": "Noting that a large number of IAS officers have not filed annual immovable property returns, a Parliamentary committee has asked the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) to form a panel to to look into it and also put in place a mechanism to check the veracity of asset details filed by bureaucrats. As many as 1,393 Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers did not file their asset details in the 2011 to 2022 period, according to a recent report of the Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice.   Keeping the wider ramifications of corruption in public administration in mind, the Committee recommends the central government to constitute a committee to examine the issue of non-submission of annual immovable property returns by public servants in detail,  said the report tabled in Parliament recently. The Committee said that DoPT should put a mechanism in place to check the veracity of the property return statement filed by public servants. It said India is a signatory to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) which mandates the state parties to establish and promote effective practices aimed at prevention of corruption. The Committee said DoPT is the nodal department for anti-corruption, including matters concerning UNCAC. The panel also took up the matter of posting of an All India Service (AIS)-Indian Foreign Service (IFS) couple at the same station and suggested framing of appropriate guidelines. It appreciated the Department of Personnel and Training for formulating guidelines for posting husband and wife, who are in government service, at the same station.  However, the Committee feels there is a lacuna in the policy which needs to be addressed. It is observed that DoPT's guidelines do not provide any relief to spouses where one of the spouses belongs to an All India Service and the other spouse belongs to the Indian Foreign Service,  said the report tabled in Parliament recently. The three All India Services are IAS, Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service.  The IFS does not have positions earmarked in the state governments except for postings in Regional Passport Offices and branch secretariats. Moreover, these positions are restricted to certain pay levels. Secondly, the AIS officer can opt for deputation but the rules require him/her to go back to the cadre for 'cooling off' period or in case of other exigencies,  the report said. Accordingly, the Committee recommended that appropriate guidelines be framed for AIS-IFS couples also.  The Department may further consider allocating the AIS officer to Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory (AGMUT) cadre and post him/her in Delhi or alternatively allocate him/her to the states contiguous to Delhi where the IFS officer remains posted for long periods to the extent possible so that the couple can remain posted at the same station,  it said.",

The move comes after the government said it was still receiving proposals for regularisation of the period of overstay beyond the approved term of deputation.  In the latest order, the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has asked all central government ministries and departments to review the status of all the deputation cases and avoid delayed closure of cases involving overstay beyond the approved term of deputation in favour of delinquent officials.   The deputationist officer, including those who are presently on deputation, would be deemed to have been relieved on the date of expiry of the deputation period unless the competent authority has with requisite approvals, extended the period of deputation, in writing, prior to the date of its expiry,  it said.  It will be the responsibility of the immediate superior officer to ensure that the deputationist does not overstay, the order said.   In the event of the officer overstaying for any reason whatsoever, he or she is liable to disciplinary action and other adverse civil service consequences which would include the period of unauthorised overstay not being counted as qualifying service for the purpose of pension and that any increment due during the period of unauthorised overstay being deferred with cumulative effect, till the date on which the officer rejoins his parent cadre,  the DoPT said, reiterating its earlier directives in this regard.  The government said it is primarily the responsibility of the borrowing organisations to ensure that deputationists are relieved on the date of expiry of their deputation tenure.   Any proposal for extension of the tenure of deputation under rules should be initiated sufficiently before the expiry of the tenure. Besides, the responsibility rests with the deputationist and the lending organisations as well, to bring to the notice of the borrowing organisation about the expiry of the deputation tenure,  the DoPT said, seeking  strict compliance  with its order dated March 22.  It said the powers to extend the tenure of deputation, where absolutely necessary in the public interest, to the borrowing organisations up to a period not exceeding seven years at a stretch with the approval of the minister of their administrative ministry or department concerned.   However, in spite of relaxation allowed in the provisions governing tenure of deputation or foreign service, proposals continue to be received in this department for regularisation of the period of overstay beyond the approved term of deputation,  the DoPT said.",

        "articleBody": "It was the arrest of Kulwinder Singh Khanpuria in November 2022 by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) which helped investigators join the dots off alleged efforts to revive the Khalistani network and revive Punjab militancy.Khanpuria is associated with banned Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) and was arrested while trying to enter India from Thailand. He was staying in Pakistan and a red corner notice (RCN) was issued against him. He is a close aide of Harwinder Singh Sandhu aka Rinda and the two were allegedly involved in the May 2022 RPG attack in Mohali. The network of pro-Khalistani militant groups has been alive for the past three years in Punjab, according to security agencies, with the emergence of 30-year-old radical preacher and Waris De Punjab (WPD) chief Amritpal Singh. Now declared a fugitive, Singh has been on the run for the past week. The state police and central agencies have not been able to catch him as he continues to dodge the cops. The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently rapped the state police for  intelligence failure  and for not being able to apprehend him despite 80,000 police personnel in the state. The Sunday ET takes a look at the rise of Amritpal Singh and Khalistan 2.0 aided by drones, drugs, arms and inimical neighbours and what ails Punjab Police.The rise of Amritpal SinghThirty-year-old Amritpal Singh was living in Dubai and working as a truck driver. He first came to India during the 2021 farmer protests and later after the death of Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu, more famously known as Sidhu Moosewale, in 2022. He is the chief patron of WPD and started Amrit Sanchar to wean away youths from drugs. Police claim that in the garb of a de-addiction campaign, he started a campaign, Khalsa Veer, to strengthen his organisation by going to villages. He stormed a police station in Ajnala, on February 24 to secure release of his associate, Lovepreet Toofan, who, according to him. was falsely implicated by the police. The police had to release Toofan and could not take action against the mob. Police claimed that Singh deliberately put Bir of Guru Grant Sahib in a minibus during the Ajnala incident, preventing police from acting.On March 18, the police initiated a crackdown against WPD and claimed that Singh might be involved in anti-national activities. A large number of Sikhs, however, did not believe the police version and suspected that Singh might be in the custody of police. This forced the police to release videos and route of Singh's escape which so far has been tracked to Haryana.  Bhai Amritpal was only trying to wean away youths from drugs. He was protesting against wrongful arrest at Ajnala. There is a tacit support for him across Punjab among youths and those outside Punjab (diaspora),  said Daljeet Singh, a resident of Jalandhar. Following the arrest of 200 suspects, the opposition mounted an attack on the Punjab government and police on targeting innocent youths. The police later clarified that only 30 persons have been charged with criminal cases while the rest are under preventive detention.Role of Khalistan 2.0The NIA said that the arrest of Kulwinder Singh by NIA led to revelation of the role of Harwinder Singh Sandhu aka Rinda, originally from Tarn Taran, who migrated to Nanded in Maharashtra after committing crimes in Punjab. Later he crossed the Nepal border and got shelter in Pakistan due to proximity with BKI chief Wadhawa Singh Babbar. The Mohali attack was planned in Pakistan but Rinda was communicating not with his Punjab gangsters, but gangsters of Canada, for deniability of Pakistani handlers, according to the NIA. The Punjab Police said its investigation found involvement of Nishan Singh, a resident of Tarn Taran whose foreign handler is Lakhbir Singh Landa, a history sheeter, currently staying in Canada. Landa arranged the safe house, arms and ammunition for the Mohali attack, according to the police.Ahead of Khanpuria's arrest, the Delhi Police's Special Cell nabbed four sharpshooters of the module in September-October 2022 last year. Two of them, Harmender Singh and Sukhdev, revealed that they coordinated several drone droppings of arms and ammunition, according to the police. It said the supply chain of arms consignment run by Rinda was meant to ensure supplies to the Lowrence Bishnoi gang, the Davinder Bambiha syndicate and also criminals who operated independently. The case was later transferred to the NIA which charge-sheeted Lawrence Bishnoi, Goldy Brar and 12 others on Friday. The total number of suspects in this terrorist-gangster nexus stands at 26, as per the NIA. The agency said in its charge-sheet that it had unearthed another module of narco-terrorists where one person Dharminder Singh was found to have links with Pakistan based Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) chief Harmeet Singh and Dubai based drug smuggler Jasmeet Singh Hakimzada in running drug trafficking in Punjab. The Taliban-Pakistan network coupled with Khalistani groups active in UK, Canada, Germany, US and Australia are increasingly using the drug trade to ramp up the Khalistani cause, it said.Punjab Police's TroublesThe Punjab Police was at the forefront of battling pro-Khalistan militancy in the 1980s and the first half of 1990s. After 2015, a series of sacrilegious incidents took place. In one of them, police opened fire, leading to the death of two Sikh protestors, after which a probe against the policemen was initiated. Last month, the Punjab Police's special investigation team (SIT) filed a charge-sheet in first information reports (FIRs) registered in 2015 and 2018 in the Kotkapura firing case, naming then Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, his deputy and son Sukhbir Badal, and then state police chief Sumedh Singh Saini among seven key accused. A few police officers were also named, including the then Ludhiana commissioner Param Raj Umranangal, the then deputy inspector general Amar Singh Chahal and the then Faridkot senior superintendent police (SSP) Sukhmander Singh Mann.The inaction against the protestors at Ajnala might be a reason no senior policeman wants to face action later when the regime changes. Punjab cops were caught on the wrong side during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's security lapse amid political uncertainty in the state. Recently, top Punjab Police officials were slapped with major penalties, including dismissal, demotion and reduction in pension and many were asked to explain why disciplinary proceedings should not be initiated against them as recommended by a Supreme Court committee that probed the breach of security during the PM's visit to the state on January 5 last year.Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann had ordered the state's personnel department to initiate disciplinary proceedings for major penalty against S Chattopadhyaya (former director general police or DGP) and other senior police officers.The crackdown on Amritpal Singh and WPD may have lifted the morale of Punjab Police but his arrest could give it a significant boost, according to people aware of the matter.",

Results indicate that the cumulative fiscal burden in case of OPS could be as high as 4.5 times that of NPS (National Pension Scheme), with the additional burden reaching 0.9% of GDP annually by 2060,  wrote Rachit Solanki, Somnath Sharma, RK Sinha, Samir Ranjan Behera and Atri Mukherjee in the article in the RBI's September bulletin, which was released on Monday.The authors are from the Department of Economic and Policy Research and the Monetary Policy Department of the RBI. The article was prepared under the guidance of RBI Deputy Governor Michael Patra. The view expressed in the article does not necessarily represent that of the RBI.Recently, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh announced return to OPS from NPS, with the immediate gain emanating from discontinuation of spending on NPS contribution of the current employees, the authors wrote.  In future, however, the unfunded OPS is likely to exert severe pressures on their finances, especially with increasing longevity,  they wrote. 103766626Under the OPS scheme, which is a defined benefit scheme, after retirement, state government employees get a pension fixed at 50% of the last drawn salary and the benefit of dearness relief revisions, with the pay-outs fixed and with no deduction from salary, the authors said. Thus, the OPS is an unfunded, 'pay-as-you go' system in which current taxpayers continuously finance retirees' pensions. While OPS may be more attractive from the employee's perspective, it puts an enormous financial burden on the government,  they wrote.On the other hand, NPS is a scheme in which the employees' defined contribution is 10% of basic salary and dearness allowance, with a matching contribution from the state government, they said, adding that by investing a part of this contribution in equity and debt markets, the NPS aims to ensure good pensions for retiring employees while bringing down the budgetary burden. The NPS does not pose a pension obligation risk to the employer at the time of retirement, as the payments are made from the pension fund created through contributions from the employee and the employer during the service period,  the authors wrote.",

With this viability gap funding, solar power generation costs would come down and farmers can benefit from lower electricity tariff... But the Bengal government has not implemented it,  Singh said here. The electricity distribution company of the state government would only have to invite bids from private agencies, which set up solar panels, and then buy power from them, he said. The agency with the lowest bid would be awarded the contract. It would also be able to provide electricity at the cheapest rate, the minister said.  There are no financial implications on the part of the state government,  Singh said. He was in the city to witness the launch of the Rs 13,000-crore PM Vishwakarma Yojana in Delhi, via the virtual mode.

In fact, the previous BJP regime cut the monthly PDS rice quota from 7 kg to 5 kg. \u201cAre our guarantee programmes not development work,\u201d the CM asked.",

        "articleBody": "Guwahati: There was uproar in the Assam assembly on Friday as the opposition MLAs sought discussion over the allegation that a company linked to CM Himanta Biswa Sarma's wife got government subsidy. There were as many as three adjournments and oppositions walked out the house for the rest of the day. Congress MLA Kamalakhya Dey Purkayastha sought to know from the Revenue and Disaster Management Minister Jogen Mohan if the plot of land in Kaliabor area was allotted to Riniki Bhuyan Sarma's company under the state's 'Basundhara' scheme. Riniki Bhuyan Sarma, wife of Assam chief minister is chairperson and Managing Director of Pride East Entertainments Private Limited. Speaker Biswajit Daimary said that the matter was not related to the original question and the chief minister is not present in the house. Purkayastha insisted on an answer and there was trading of barbs between the MLAs. Speaker adjourned the house for 30 minutes. When the house reconvened, leader of opposition Debabrata Saikia raised the matter of his notice for Zero-hour discussion. Deputy Speaker Numal Momin, who was in the chair, did not allow discussion. Congress and lone CPI(M) rushed to the well of the house and sat on a dharna. BJP MLAs rushed to the well of the house and there was pandemonium. Following which house was adjourned for five minutes. When the house re-assembled, opposition MLAs shouted slogans against the government from the well of the house. BJP MLAs came to the well of the house and the House was again adjourned for 15 minutes. When the house gathered again deputy leader of opposition Rakibul Hussain said that as the Chair did not allow immediate discussion, the Congress MLAs were walking out for the rest of the day. CPI(M) MLA and the Independent MLA also joined them. Sarma on Thursday said he was willing to accept any punishment, including retirement from public life, if there is any evidence that his wife has received or claimed any amount from the government of India. The Opposition parties had earlier said that a firm run by Sarma's wife allegedly received Rs 10 Crore under a subsidy scheme. Member of Parliament, Gaurav Gogoi has sought the resignation of Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma in light of recent developments. Gogoi on Friday while addressing mediapersons has raised serious ethical questions about this allocation, asserting that it hardly matters as to how much money has been credited to the Chief Minister's family account wherein government subsidies should be directed toward local entrepreneurs and farmers genuinely in need of support. Gogoi has demanded a comprehensive investigation into the rapid acquisition of a substantial agricultural land plot by a media house owned by the Chief Minister's family and its subsequent conversion into industrial property within a short period of time at a lightning speed. He has expressed concerns about the speed and nature of these transactions, emphasizing the need for a thorough inquiry to maintain transparency and uphold ethical standards. In the interest of accountability and transparency, MP Gaurav Gogoi has called upon Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma to disclose the precise amount of money received by M/S Pride East Entertainment in the form of grants and subsidies from the Assam state government so far, if any.He underscores the importance of applying uniform ethical standards to both central and state government grants saying if accepting money as grants from the Union Government is considered as not ethical, grants from the state government to the accused company be treated the same way. Gogoi welcomed any legal action and assured that the accused company will be required to present all relevant documents, including land and bank records, in a court of law. He believes this will bring clarity to the situation. Riniki Bhuyan Sarma has announced to file a Rs 10 Crore defamation case against Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi. Sarma stated in X on Thursday , \u201cThe reply itself clarifies the fact that the Government of India has not released any funds to the mentioned company. I want to emphasize once again that neither my wife nor the company she is associated with has received or claimed any amount from the Government of India. If anyone can provide evidence to the contrary, I am willing to accept any punishment including retirement from public life.\u201d On Thursday, Gogoi tweeted Union Minister Piyush Goyal's reply to a question raised in parliament in March regarding the Centre's investment initiatives in Assam. The whole day yesterday Himanta Biswa Sarma parroted one line regarding his wife's firm. For his benefit I am stating the reply of Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal in Parliament. Piyush Goyal's reply has exposed the truth and both Ministers need to clarify,  Gaurav Gogoi said. Gogoi posted in X a reply given on the matter by Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal in Parliament. The response mentions that Pride East Entertainments Private Limited has submitted a project worth Rs 25.877 crore under a central initiative to invest in Assam to support industries there however Rs 10 Crore was approved. Gogoi posted screengrab from the Union food processing ministry website which pointed out that the same firm had been approved a grant of Rs 10 crore under Centre's Kisan Sampada scheme. Riniki Bhuyan Sharma had stated in a statement, \u201cPride East Entertainments Pvt. Ltd. is an independent entity in existence since 2006 with business interests in varied sectors. It is a law abiding company with all its financial records in the public domain. With a long & successful business track record, Pride East Entertainments Pvt. Ltd.-like any other qualifying enterprise- is eligible to participate in government supported programs/incentive schemes. However in the present case, pertaining to the PM Kisan Sampada Scheme, Pride East Entertainments Pvt. Ltd has neither claimed or received a single paisa of government subsidy, despite meeting all the eligibility criteria. This is nothing but an attack to malign and defame a 17- year old Assamese enterprise, which has adhered to every aspect of the law, headed by a woman entrepreneur. To protect the reputation of our hardworking employees from this slanderous campaign of Gaurav Gogoi- Member of Parliament, I am thereby constrained to file a case of defamation with Rs 10 crore in damages against him in the court of law\u201d.",

        "articleBody": "Issues pertaining to the proposed bilateral investment treaty being negotiated between India and the UK along with a free trade agreement will figure prominently during the visit of a high-level team from Britain here, an official said. UK Secretary of State for Business and Trade Kemi Badenoch and Director General for Trade Negotiations at the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) Amanda Brooks are visiting India this week.  Besides participating in the G20 Trade and Investment Ministerial Meeting in Jaipur on August 24-25, the UK minister will hold bilateral talks with Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on August 26 here and review the progress of talks on the free trade agreement.  The UK minister is also expected to meet Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on various issues, including the bilateral investment treaty.  Brooks would also meet senior officials of the department of economic affairs in the finance ministry, which is leading the negotiations on the investment treaty.  These meetings assume significance as negotiations for the free trade agreement have reached a final stage. Investment treaty is being negotiated as a separate agreement between India and the UK and the two countries are looking at signing both the agreements simultaneously.  Though talks for most of the chapters have been closed, both sides have intensified negotiations to iron out differences on issues including rules of origin, intellectual property rights and the investment pact.  Sources said that at present the investment treaty is a hurdle in the conclusion of both the agreements simultaneously, however, negotiations are going on to bridge the differences.  These investment treaties help in promoting and protecting investments in each other's countries. The main point of contention involved in this pact is about the mechanism for the settlement of disputes.  India has proposed to first utilise all local judicial remedies for settlement of disputes before initiating an international arbitration.  India has earlier lost two international arbitration cases against British telecom giant Vodafone and Cairn Energy plc of the UK over the retrospective levy of taxes.  On automobiles and whiskey, an important demand of the UK, India has agreed to give duty concessions to British industry. Popular British whiskey brands include Johnnie Walker, Black Label and Chivas Regal.  To provide duty concessions in the automobile sector, several rounds of consultations have been held with the domestic players in India. According to an expert, the UK-based auto makers like JLR, Bentley, Rolls-Royce, and Aston Martin, cater to the luxury segment, while Indian manufacturers are mostly in the mass segment.  The 12th round of talks between India and the UK is in progress here. Out of the total 26 chapters in the proposed FTA, 19 have been closed. Investment is being negotiated as a separate agreement (bilateral investment treaty) between India and the UK.  The Indian industry is demanding greater access for its skilled professionals from sectors like IT, and healthcare in the UK market, besides market access for several goods at nil customs duties.  On the other hand, the UK is seeking a significant cut in import duties on goods such as scotch whiskey, automobiles, lamb meat, and certain confectionary items.  Britain is also looking for more opportunities for UK services in Indian markets in segments such as telecommunications, legal and financial services like banking. The bilateral trade between the countries increased to USD 20.36 billion in 2022-23 from USD 17.5 billion in 2021-22.",

        "articleBody": "Empanelled mediators in consumer cases will now be paid a fee in the range of Rs 3,000-5,000 by the government which will lead to the settlement of more complaints through mediation cells, the Consumer Affairs Ministry said on Friday. The ministry took a decision in this regard after a series of consultations with various stakeholders, and during regional workshops held in northeastern and northern states, an official release said. It was observed that a substantial number of cases are not resolved through mediation because the parties in the disputes are observed to be reluctant in paying the fee of the mediator. Based on the suggestions, the ministry has  decided to pay the fees of the empanelled mediator from the Consumer Welfare Fund,  the release said. According to the consumer affairs ministry release, the amount of dispute, or the fee of the mediator as set by the President of the Commission, or the fees prescribed below, whichever is least, will be paid to the mediator. A fee of about Rs 3,000 will be paid to a mediator for successful mediation in district commissions, while Rs 5,000 in the state commissions. That apart, about Rs 600 per case subject to a maximum of Rs 1,800 regardless of the number of connected cases will be paid to mediate in the district commission. About Rs 1,000 per case subject to a maximum of Rs 3,000 regardless of the number of connected cases will be paid to mediate in state commissions. In case of failed mediation, about Rs 500 and 1,000 per case will be paid to a mediator in district and state commissions, respectively. The fee will be paid from the interest accrued on the Consumer Welfare (Corpus) Fund, established with co-contribution from the State and the Department of Consumer Affairs. To effect these changes, the ministry has amended the Consumer Welfare Fund Guidelines and included Section IV Purpose (m) on reimbursement of legal expenses incurred by a complainant, or class of complainants in a consumer dispute, after its final adjudication.

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: A court here on Friday issued fresh notices to BBC, Wikimedia Foundation and US-based digital library Internet Archive through the Union Ministry of Law and Justice after noting that they were foreign entities and thus subject to rules formulated under the Hague Convention. Additional District Judge (ADJ) Ruchika Singla was hearing a criminal complaint filed by BJP leader Vinay Kumar Singh seeking to restrain them from publishing or broadcasting a documentary on the 2002 Gujarat riots or any other material defamatory to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP).   It is clear that as per the rules formulated under the Hague Convention and by the Government of India, the summons/notices in foreign countries can be effected only through the Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India, which has admittedly not been done in the present case,  the judge said.   Hence, it is directed that the summons be issued afresh to the defendants (BBC, Wikimedia Foundation and Internet Archive) on the filing of process fee within seven days to be served through the Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice as per rules,  ADJ Singla added.  Earlier, after being summoned by the court, BBC and Wikimedia Foundation raised objections, saying that the service of summons was not proper as both were foreign entities based in the UK and the US respectively.  They said according to the Hague Convention, the service upon a foreign entity had to be served through the prescribed rules.  Noting that the BBC was a public service broadcaster headquartered in London, the court said the plaintiff (Singh) cannot take the plea that it is an Indian entity.  The court also noted a circular from the Delhi High Court, dated September 13, 2011, where it referred to an office memorandum issued by the Union Ministry of Law and Justice, Department of Legal Affairs (Judicial Section), dated August 18, 2011, which directed that the service of summons or notices in foreign countries shall be under the provisions of the Hague Convention.  According to the provisions, such summons or notices could only be served through the ministry's Department of Legal Affairs, the court noted.   As the defendants are foreign entities, the service must be effected as per the guidelines issued by the Delhi High Court...,  the court said.  The court also rejected the argument that as the defendants have already engaged their counsels, who had appeared in the court, the service was deemed to be effected, and that the plea of improper service cannot be taken at the present stage.  It said the mere filing of the 'vakalatnama' by the counsel cannot do away with the mandatory requirement of the service of the summons upon the defendant under the prescribed procedure.  According to complainant Vinay Kumar Singh, the two-part BBC documentary  India: The Modi Question  had defamed organisations like the BJP, the RSS and the VHP.",

The activists, who fled Hong Kong following the imposition of the law, are accused of crimes such as subversion and colluding with foreign forces. The bounties have been criticized by the US, UK, and Australia, and Lee has called on the public to assist police in locating the activists. ",

        "articleBody": "Hong Kong's leader has called on eight overseas activists to turn themselves in a day after police put out bounties on them for violating the city's national security law. Police on Monday offered rewards of HK$1 million ($128,000) each for information leading to the arrests of eight prominent democracy activists based abroad, accusing them of crimes such as subversion and colluding with foreign forces. City leader John Lee said Tuesday that he supported the police action and called on the activists to surrender themselves.  The only way to end their destiny of being an abscondee who will be pursued for life is to surrender,  Lee told reporters, adding they would otherwise  spend their days in fear . All eight fled Hong Kong after Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on the financial hub in 2020 to quell dissent after huge, sometimes violent pro-democracy protests in 2019 were quashed.  Lee called on the public to assist police, adding that even the activists'  relatives and friends  could become informants. The offer has been criticised by the United States, Britain and Australia -- countries where the wanted activists reportedly reside. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller condemned the bounties as part of China's  transnational repression efforts  and called for their withdrawal.  The extraterritorial application of the Beijing-imposed National Security Law is a dangerous precedent that threatens the human rights and fundamental freedoms of people all over the world,  he added. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, meanwhile, said her government was  deeply disappointed  by the bounties.  We have consistently expressed concerns about the broad application of the National Security Law to arrest or pressure pro-democracy figures and civil society,  Wong said Tuesday. Britain will  not tolerate any attempts by China to intimidate and silence individuals in the UK and overseas , said UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly.   The UK will always defend the universal right to freedom of expression and stand up for those who are targeted.  Following Cleverly's statements, the Chinese embassy in London said Britain had interfered with China's internal affairs by  openly (offering) protection for fugitives .  This is crude interference in Hong Kong's rule of law and China's internal affairs,  they said.  China expresses strong dissatisfaction and firmly opposes this.  Asked about the criticism abroad, Hong Kong leader Lee said the city was not unique in having a national security law that was enforceable internationally.  I'm not afraid of any political pressure that is put on us, because we do what we believe is right,  Lee said.'I am not afraid' -  Since it was enacted three years ago, Hong Kong's national security law has led to the shutdown of scores of civil society groups, political parties and pro-democracy media outlets. It has also weakened the firewall that once separated Hong Kong's legal system from that of mainland China. Police have so far arrested 260 people under the national security law, with 79 of them convicted or awaiting sentencing.  While the law applies to people outside of the city, officials have not specified how enforcement is possible. The eight wanted activists include former pro-democracy lawmakers Nathan Law, Ted Hui and Dennis Kwok.  Veteran unionist Mung Siu-tat is also among the wanted as are activists Elmer Yuen, Finn Lau, Anna Kwok and Kevin Yam. Kwok told AFP the bounties may indirectly lead to threats against those on the wanted list.  (The authorities) want pro-Beijing members of the general public to be driven by populism and to bring us inconveniences or even physical threats,  she said. But Kwok said,  I am not afraid .  Actually, what they did makes me see even more clearly that what I have been doing is right.  The other activists were equally defiant.   I am just a Hong Konger who speaks out for Hong Kongers,  Nathan Law wrote on Twitter Monday.  We should not limit ourselves, self-censor, be intimidated, or live in fear. ",

According to the terms of reference for the committee, it will evaluate and analyse the operation of the present arbitration ecosystem of the country, including the working of the Arbitration Act, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses and challenges vis-a-vis other important foreign jurisdictions.  The panel has to submit its report within 30 days, the office memorandum issued on Wednesday stated.  The committee has also been asked to recommend a framework of model arbitration system which is efficient, effective and economical and caters to the requirements of the users.  The panel will also devise strategy for developing a competitive environment in the arbitration services market for domestic and international parties that can subserve the interests of the users, particularly in building a regime of cost-effective arbitration.  Under arbitration, the parties concerned, instead of approaching courts, opt for private dispute resolution through arbitrators. The decision of arbitrators is binding.  The Department of Legal Affairs, the office memorandum said, is taking several steps to strengthen the dispute resolution environment in the country and promoting ease of doing business through reforms in laws from time to time.  As a part of continuous endeavour in this direction, the department is considering the need to further reform the working of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996.  The prime reason for the exercise is guided with a view to reduce court intervention in the whole process to the minimum and make arbitration a truly party-driven process, cost-effective and with time-bound finality being attached to the award, it said.",

The provisions require only the declaration of mandatory information including retail sales price in the form of MRP, country of origin, size and dimensions of the commodity where the sizes of the commodity in the package are relevant, unit sale price and consumer care details, on the pre-packaged commodities based on which the consumer can take an informed decision,  it saidThe provisions are applicable on indigenously manufactured as well as imported medical devices.Earlier the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMeD), Association of Diagnostic Manufacturers of India (ADMI), and Surgical Dressings Manufacturers Association of India (SDMAI) represented that the ministry of health and CDSCO can amend Drugs & Cosmetics Act & Medical Device Rules, 2012 to harmonise labelling requirements with packaged commodities rules.These associations had requested that enforcement of Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 and right to regulate by DoCA (department of consumer affairs) should continue to be maintained as consumer protection requirements (under Packaged Commodities Rules) are complementary to patient safety/protection requirements (under MDR) and one cannot always be substitute for the other.

        "articleBody": "Today is the World Metrology Day, which commemorates the signing of the Metre Convention in 1875. This treaty established the International System of Units (SI), the most widely used system of measurement. The convention set the framework for global collaboration in the science of measurement.Metrology is the main pillar of quality infrastructure, essential for science, engineering, manufacturing, trade and healthcare. The theme for this year is 'Measurements supporting the global food system', aptly chosen in view of the increasing challenges of global food- supply chains caused by climate change.In India, metrology is administered through the Legal Metrology Act 2009, which functions as a measure to regulate the standards of weights and measures used in trade and commerce. Its aim is to protect consumers from non- standard, false or misleading trade descriptions while providing assurance of correct quantity of goods purchased. The Act also streamlines the measurement standards used in the country and aligns these with international standards.Everyday, crores of consumers across the country buy a multitude of goods to fulfil their daily needs. Whether it is toothpaste, a packet of milk, vegetables, fruit, bread, medicines or fuel, they are assured about the quantity in most transactions because of the trust built through a robust framework of legal metrology. Imagine a consumer measuring and weighing everything that she purchases, whether a litre of milk or 500 gm of sugar or 10 litres of petrol.In India, the history of measurement systems dates back to early Indus Valley Civilisation. During the Maurya empire (322-185 BCE), a comprehensive system of weights and measures was adopted with regulations for the usage. Interestingly, in the Manusmriti, one of the duties of the king was to 'examine the weights and balances every six months to ensure true measurements and to mark them with the royal stamp'.It is quite a challenge for government agencies to strike a balance between the facilitation of ease of doing business and protecting the interest of the consumers. While excessive criminal provisions can deter investor confidence, a lax regime can damage the consumer trust in quantity assurance. The department of consumer affairs (DCA) walked the tightrope and extensively engaged with all stakeholders, including representatives of state governments, trade, industry, business and voluntary consumer organisations, to arrive at a consensus on decriminalising many provisions of the Act.Violations where mala fide intent cannot be established, and those without serious implications, are being decriminalised through the landmark Jan Vishwas Bill. Like in any regulatory framework, the fear of rent-seeking and corruption must be addressed through extensive use of technology to make the framework discretion-free by minimising human intervention.The conventional system of metrology services requires significant time to follow established protocols, including paperwork. Stakeholders around the world are considering digital technologies, such as big data, the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain and cloud computing to provide metrology solutions that result in automated and paperless systems with transparent customer service.The creation of 'Virtual Instruments' and 'Digital Twins' is the result of advanced mathematical models of measurement tools. These technologies let organisations develop virtual representations of physical products, processes or services using real-time data, mock- ups, algorithms and AI. These technologies often cost less than physical prototypes, allowing an infinite number of variations.In line with GoI's aggressive push for Digital India, DCA is currently developing a blockchain-based solution to ensure a tamper-proof system of traceability and validation of issued certificates. Most of the interface with industry is being digitalised through the National Single Window System (NSWS). Adequate human capacities in digital metrology are being developed at the Indian Institute of Legal Metrology (IILM) in Ranchi, in partnership with IIT BHU, Varanasi.With its digital prowess, India has the potential to become the global supplier to meet the unprecedented demand for digital metrology and remote calibrations. With that, India can promise both assurance of quality as well as quantity, not only to the millions of domestic consumers but also to the rapidly expanding export market. Let's do it.The writer is secretary, department of consumer affairs, GoI",

        "articleBody": "The Supreme Court verdict giving the Delhi government control over Services matters has come into force with  immediate effect  and any officer not complying with it will be held liable for contempt of court, the city government has said. The city government's Services department had sought the opinion of the Law department after the top court's verdict last week.  The judgment of the Constitution Bench has come into force with immediate effect. Any officer not giving effect to the judgment of the Constitution Bench shall be held liable for contempt,  said a note signed by Law Minister Kailash Gahlot. Gahlot also said the opinion of the Law department's principal secretary was read by him and it  appeared to be more of a practical advice rather than a strict legal opinion. His opinion also suffers from inherent contradictions . The Services department had also sought the opinion of the Delhi government's standing counsel (civil) on the implementation of the verdict. The Supreme Court said the Delhi government has legislative powers over Services matters and the Lt Governor is bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers, the note stated. The judgment has retrospective effect, it added.  ...not complying with any direction of the Government of Delhi for the reason of awaiting judgment of a regular three (judge) bench is nothing but defiance of the order passed by the Constitution Bench and is an attempt to undermine the authority of not only the Government of Delhi but also the Constitution Bench, which is highly undesirable and contemptuous in nature,  the note added. The top court's verdict is immediately applicable and the council of ministers must start discharging its responsibilities with respect to Services with immediate effect, the note stated.  The decision of the Regular Bench will have to be in conformity with the decision of the Constitution Bench. The regular bench is bound by the decision of the Constitution Bench,  it said. After the Supreme Court verdict, the Lt Governor cannot exercise executive control over Services anymore, the note further said. If the council of ministers waits for the Regular Bench decision to discharge its responsibilities with respect to the Services matter, transfer and postings will not be executed and there will be a  vacuum  in governance, it pointed out. A five-judge Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, in a unanimous verdict, put an end to the eight-year-old dispute between the Centre and the Delhi government triggered by a 2015 Ministry of Home Affairs notification asserting its control over Services, holding the National Capital Territory administration is unlike other Union Territories and has been  accorded a 'sui generis' (unique) status by the Constitution .",

        "description": "The Supreme Court on Friday directed the Centre and the state governments to undertake a time bound exercise to verify whether sexual harassment committees have been constituted in all ministries and the departments. The top court said there are serious lapses in the enforcement of the 2013 Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) Act.",
        "datePublished": "2023-05-12T16:42:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "Expressing concern over lack of committees in government departments to probe sexual harassment allegations at workplace, the Supreme Court on Friday said the issue needs urgent amelioration through robust and efficient implementation of the Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) Act. The top court said it is disquieting to note that there are serious lapses in the enforcement of the Act even after such a long time and termed it as a  sorry state of affairs  which reflects poorly on all the state functionaries, public authorities and private undertakings.A bench of justices A S Bopanna and Hima Kohli said the working of the Act is centred on the constitution of internal complaints committees (ICCs) by every employer at the workplace and constitution of local committees (LCs) and internal committees(ICs) by the appropriate government.The apex court said an improperly constituted ICC/LC/IC, would be an impediment in conducting an inquiry into a complaint of sexual harassment at the workplace, as envisaged under the statute and the rules. It will be equally counterproductive to have an ill prepared committee conduct a half-baked inquiry that can lead to serious consequences, namely, imposition of major penalties on the delinquent employee, to the point of termination of service. It is disquieting to note that there are serious lapses in the enforcement of the Act even after such a long passage of time,  the bench said.The top court also noted that this  glaring lacuna  has been recently brought to the fore by a national daily newspaper that has conducted and published a survey of 30 national sports federations in the country and reported that 16 out of them have not constituted an ICC till date. Where the ICC have been found to be in place, they do not have the stipulated number of members or lack the mandatory external member. This is indeed a sorry state of affairs and reflects poorly on all the State functionaries, public authorities, private undertakings, organizations and institutions that are duty bound to implement the PoSH Act in letter and spirit,  it said.The apex court said being a victim of such a deplorable act not only dents the self esteem of a woman, it also takes a toll on her emotional, mental and physical health. It is often seen that when women face sexual harassment at the workplace, they are reluctant to report such misconduct. Many of them even drop out from their job. One of the reasons for this reluctance to report is that there is an uncertainty about who to approach under the Act for redressal of their grievance. Another is the lack of confidence in the process and its outcome. This social malady needs urgent amelioration through robust and efficient implementation of the Act. To achieve this, it is imperative to educate the complainant victim about the import and working of the Act,  the bench said.The top court said the victims must be made aware of how a complaint can be registered, the procedure that would be adopted to process the complaint, the objective manner in which the ICC/LC/IC is expected to function under the statute. However salutary this enactment may be, it will never succeed in providing dignity and respect that women deserve at the workplace unless and until there is strict adherence to the enforcement regime and a proactive approach by all the State and non-State actors. If the working environment continues to remain hostile, insensitive and unresponsive to the needs of women employees, then the Act will remain an empty formality,  the bench said.The top court said if the  authorities/managements/employers  cannot assure them a safe and secure work place, they will fear stepping out of their homes to make a dignified living and exploit their talent and skills to the hilt. It is, therefore, time for the Union government and the state governments to take affirmative action and make sure that the altruistic object behind enacting the PoSH Act is achieved in real terms,  the bench said.The top court's observation came while hearing a plea filed by Aureliano Fernandes, former head of department of Goa University, challenging an order of Bombay high court regarding allegations of sexual harassment against him.The high court had dismissed his plea against an order of the Executive Council of Goa University (Disciplinary Authority) which dismissed him from services and disqualification from the future employment.The top court set aside the high court order noting procedural lapses in the inquiry proceedings and violation of principles of natural justice.",

        "articleBody": "The AAP on Thursday termed the Supreme Court's verdict on the Centre-Delhi services row a  tight slap  on the mission to topple governments through  unconstitutional ways  while Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the judgment will ensure increased pace of development. The chief minister also expressed his  heartfelt thanks  to the Supreme Court for  doing justice to the people of Delhi . Following the top court verdict, Kejriwal has called a meeting with his cabinet ministers. In a unanimous verdict, the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the Delhi government has legislative and executive powers over services. Welcoming the verdict, the AAP said in a tweet in Hindi,  The elected government will have the power of transfer-posting of officers. Officers will work only through the elected government.  The Lt Governor will have no power over the officers to stop the work of the people of Delhi, the party said. Gopal Rai, the state convener of the AAP's Delhi unit, said at a press conference,  This is a tight slap on the Modi government and its mission to topple elected governments through unconstitutional methods. The Modi government had done the work of usurping the powers of the Delhi government through the Lt Governor and the Ministry of Home Affairs.  The Modi government was pushing democracy into darkness by destabilising governments.  They were running a  campaign to paralyse the work being done by the Delhi government , and the verdict is a  ray of hope in darkness , he added. Services Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj said Delhi's people have won the battle that was being fought by Kejriwal for nearly nine years.  Today, this battle has established one thing in the country -- there is one institution that will stand up and restore order whenever there will be a threat. That institution is the apex court.  Today, the Supreme Court has delivered a historic verdict. I feel that in today's time this verdict will be remembered in a long time,  he added. Calling Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud a national hero, the minister said the people of Delhi are indebted to him.  When we were small, we would watch Amitabh Bachchan playing a police inspector in a film and dream that we will become a policeman when we grow up. Similarly, if children would see doctor or a lawyer in a film, they would want to become that. For every kid who understands even a little bit about the state of affairs in the country and judiciary, there is one hero -- Chief Justice Chandrachud. Now they will say that they want to become a judge when they grow up. The country has got a hero in him,  he said.He also thanked the five-judge constitution bench on behalf of the people of Delhi.  We bow down before them. They have got back their right and it is a tight slap on the Centre,  he said. Delhi Minister Atishi said the verdict has  safeguarded the country's constitution and democracy .  The prime minister cannot tolerate that some other party wins. Wherever the BJP loses, unconstitutionally they carry out 'Operation Lotus' and poach MLAs there. When they could not topple the AAP government through these ways, they attempted to take away its powers,  she noted. She added that the Supreme Court has given a clear verdict that the government chosen by the people has powers to take decisions for them.  When people have chosen Kejriwal, then he will take a decision on behalf of the people of Delhi. Thanks to the Supreme Court, they have not just given a decision but also safeguarded the country's democracy and Constitution,  she said. Explaining what the verdict means, Bharadwaj said all types of officers were reporting to the Centre via the Lt Governor earlier.  If an officer was inefficient, there was no way of shifting him to some other department or controlling them. But now, this verdict has made it clear that executive powers and legislative powers lie with the government. It has been reiterated that the Lt Governor is bound by the aid and advice of the government in areas apart from police, public order and land,  he said. Asked whether the government can now refuse to share papers related to the chief minister's residence with the Lt Governor, he said,  I think it should not be looked at in terms of the chief minister's residence or the Lt Governor's residence. It is a matter of principles and we will act as per principles.  Atishi added that the Lt Governor can only see papers but he does not have any right to take decisions on them. AAP Rajya Sabha Raghav Chadha called the verdict a  landmark decision  and said it sends a stern message.  Satyamev Jayate. Delhi wins. Hon'ble Supreme Court's landmark judgment sends a stern message that officers working with the government of Delhi are meant to serve (the) people of Delhi through the elected government and not unelected usurpers parachuted by Centre to stall governance, namely LG,  Chadha tweeted. Atishi called the verdict  historic  and said earlier in a tweet in Hindi,  After a long battle, the Supreme Court got the Arvind Kejriwal government its right. Now, no one will be able to obstruct the work of the people of Delhi.  This historic decision is a win for the people of Delhi. Now Delhi will progress at double the speed. Congratulations everyone!  Hearing the Centre versus the Delhi government case over the demarcation of power, a constitution bench headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud said an elected government needs to have control over the administration. It refused to agree with Justice Ashok Bhushan's 2019 judgment that the city government has no power over the issue of services. The constitution bench was set up to hear the legal issue concerning the scope of legislative and executive powers of the Centre and the National Capital Territory government over control of services in Delhi.",

The first meeting of the JSC was held in Israel in September 2014.According to officials, four working groups in the areas of border management, internal security and public safety, police modernization and capacity building for combating crime, crime prevention and cyber crime were established by the committee. After this, there were working group meetings in India and Israel in March and July-August, 2015 respectively.From 2015, IPS officer trainees have been visiting the Israel National Police Academy every year for a one-week long foreign exposure training at the end of their training. On India-US homeland security, officials said that the last meeting took place in January 2022 in virtual mode and was chaired by union home secretary Ajay Bhalla and under secretary for Strategy, Policy and Plans, Department of Homeland Security, Government of USA, Robert Silvers.During the 2022 meeting, both sides have agreed to hold ministerial level homeland security dialogue towards the end of 2022 but dates could not be finalised. In 2018, India and US started 2+2 security dialogue where foreign and defence ministers of India and US meet on key strategic and security issues. The last meeting of 2+2 security pact was held in Washington and was attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh and foreign affairs minister Dr S Jaishankar.",

        "description": "The Indian government has urged state governments to submit their views on same-sex marriage in the country within ten days. The move came during the second day of a court hearing regarding marriage equality in India. Although the Supreme Court previously decreed that the historic 158-year-old ban on gay sex was  indefensible , the government contends that marriage is an \u201cexclusively heterogeneous institution\u201d and, if disrupted, would cause \u201ccomplete havoc\u201d within Indias deeply religious society. Same-sex couples require \u201ca language\u201d to assert their relationships as being equal to their straight counterparts, according to Menaka Guruswamy, a senior lawyer representing petitioners in the current case.",

        "articleBody": "On the second day of India's apex court hearing the case regarding the legality of same-sex marriage in the country, the Centre filed a fresh application, urging the Constitution Bench to take into account the views of state governments since  marriage  is in concurrent list.The Constitution Bench, headed by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, comprises justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, S Ravindra Bhat, PS Narasimha and Hima Kohli.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, requested the Constitution bench that states be made parties to the proceedings.On April 18, the government's Department of Legal Affairs wrote to all Chief Secretaries of states to submit their views on same sex marriage, urging them to submit their views in 10 days so that they can present the case before the Supreme Court. It is, therefore, humbly requested that all states and Union Territories be made a party to the present proceedings and their respective stance be taken on record and in the alternative, allow the Union of India, to finish the consultative process with the states, obtains their views/apprehensions, compile the same and place it on record before this court, and only thereafter adjudicate on the present issue,  the affidavit said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s administration has contended that granting legal recognition to relationships is \u201cessentially a function of the legislature,\u201d not of the judiciary. It has also argued that marriage is an \u201cexclusively heterogeneous institution\u201d and any interference to it \u201cwould cause complete havoc\u201d in India\u2019s deeply religious society. Some people in favor of marriage equality have rejected the notion that societal norms in India do not evolve.\u201cThe problem is this notion of fragility, which is just entirely self-created,\u201d said Menaka Guruswamy, a senior lawyer representing multiple petitioners in the case, including two lesbian couples and a trans woman. \u201cHindu society has enabled reform since independence,\u201d she said, citing the changes to a series of laws in the 1950s that allowed Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists to marry across religions and castes. Other laws allowed for divorce, the chance to adopt and equal rights for women to inherit property.Now, Guruswamy said, same-sex couples require \u201ca language\u201d to present their relationships as equally authentic as those by their straight counterparts, in a society where young people grow up watching Bollywood films about \u201cmismatched lovers\u201d and \u201cparental opposition.\u201d Those stories, she said, should make it easier, not harder, for Indians to accept love in all its forms.Almost five years ago, the Supreme Court ushered in a new era for LGBTQ rights in India. The ban on gay sex, a vestige of the country\u2019s colonial past, was \u201cindefensible,\u201d the court said in its unanimous order. In that groundbreaking case, the court ruled that \u201csexual autonomy of an individual\u201d was at the core of \u201cindividual liberty,\u201d and thus had no place in the country\u2019s legal system. Those actions fueled hopes that the court would act as a socially liberal counterweight to the conservative ethos of Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and its ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. But many members of India\u2019s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community say they continue to lead marginalized lives.The apex court had on November 25 last year sought the Centre's response to separate pleas moved by two gay couples seeking enforcement of their right to marry and a direction to the authorities concerned to register their marriages under the Special Marriage Act.",

The first to aggressively challenge the certification of his successor.Now, he adds another: Even as he hopes to return to the White House in 2025, he is the first former president to be indicted.The latest line crossed by Trump challenges again the aura of the American presidency, nurtured in the infallibility of George Washington but made human over and over, through scandals born of greed and the abuse of power, corruption and naivete, sex and lies about sex.Trump is hardly the first president, in or out of office, to face legal trouble.In 1974, Richard Nixon may well have avoided criminal charges on obstruction of justice or bribery, related to the Watergate scandal, only because President Gerald Ford pardoned him just weeks after Nixon resigned the presidency. Bill Clinton's law license in his native Arkansas was suspended for five years after he reached a deal with prosecutors in 2001, at the end of his second term, over allegations that he lied under oath about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.Some historians wonder about President Warren Harding's fate had he not died in office, in 1923. Numerous officials around him would be implicated in various crimes, including Interior Secretary Albert B. Fall, whose corrupt land dealings became known as the  Teapot Dome Scandal.  The walls were closing in on him,  presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said of Harding.Trump's indictment in New York reportedly is linked to how business records were mischaracterized in connection with paying porn actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 in 2016, shortly before Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton for the presidency, to keep Daniels from going public about a sexual encounter she said she had with him years earlier. Trump denies having sex with her.Trump also is being investigated for allegedly attempting to change the 2020 vote results in Georgia, a state he narrowly lost to Democrat Joe Biden, and for his role in the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters attempted to stop the congressional certification of Biden as president. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and called the New York investigation  a witch hunt. While in office, Trump adopted the view of a Justice Department legal opinion that a president could not be indicted. Once a president leaves office, though, that protection falls away.Most ex-presidents of the past half-century have led relatively uneventful public lives - creating foundations, delivering lucrative speeches, or in the case of Jimmy Carter, doing abundant charitable works. Nixon's disgrace scarred him for years, though he eventually reemerged to talk about global affairs and counsel aspiring politicians and potential presidents, including Trump.The immediate cause of Nixon's resignation was the discovery of the  smoking gun  - Oval Office tape recordings, initiated by Nixon himself, that revealed he had ordered a cover-up of the 1972 break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington. By 1974, the scandal had expanded well beyond the initial crime. Many of Nixon's top aides had stepped down and were eventually imprisoned. Nixon himself was a possible target of the Watergate special counsel. There were partisans in Congress and on the special counsel's staff who would have liked to see Nixon indicted after the resignation - or at least believed that the pardon was premature,  says John A. Farrell, author of  Richard Nixon: The Life,  a prize-winning biography published in 2017.  But the special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, had consistently chosen to deal with Nixon via the constitutional, impeachment process. Farrell notes that Ford's pardon happened so soon after Nixon stepped down that Jaworski's office didn't have time to fully consider charges against Nixon. Ford himself would say that an  indictment, a trial, a conviction, and anything else that transpired  would have distracted the country from more immediate problems. This much can be said: Nixon himself was very worried about the possibility (of prosecution), to the point of ruining his health,  Farrell said, referring to Nixon's battles with phlebitis, the inflammation of veins in the leg.  He mused aloud about how some of the great political writing in history had been crafted in jail cells. His very worried family reached out to the White House, alerting Ford's aides of the ex-president's deteriorating condition. The administrations of Nixon and Harding were among several defined by scandal, without the president being charged.Ulysses Grant, the Union general and hero of the Civil War, was otherwise naive about those around him. Numerous members of his presidential administration were involved in financial wrongdoing, from extortion to market manipulation. Grant himself was caught for a more trivial offense. In 1872, during his first term, he was stopped twice for riding his carriage too fast. The second time Grant had to pay a $20 fine, but never spent a night in jail,  says historian Ron Chernow, whose Grant biography was published in 2017.Tragedy may have spared one future president.In the fall of 1963, Vice President Lyndon Johnson was out of favor in the Kennedy administration and in possible legal danger because his top aide, Bobby Baker, was under investigation for financial dealings and influence peddling. Johnson, with his own history of questionable finances, was denying any close ties to a man he had once claimed to love as a son.By the morning of Nov. 22, 1963, Life magazine was planning a investigation and congressional hearings were just getting started.

        "description": "The government's decision to cancel the 2018 tender and issue a fresh tender in 2022 with additional conditions was challenged in the HC by UAE-based company Seclink Technologies Corporation, which had emerged as the highest bidder in the earlier tender with a Rs 7200 crore bid.",

        "articleBody": "The Maharashtra government told the Bombay High Court on Friday the 2018 tender for the Dharavi redevelopment project was cancelled and a fresh tender was issued in 2022 because of several factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia war that affected financial and economic affairs. The Gautam Adani Group had bagged the 2022 tender with a bid of Rs 5,069 crore to redevelop an area of 259 hectares. The government's decision to cancel the 2018 tender and issue a fresh tender in 2022 with additional conditions was challenged in the HC by UAE-based company Seclink Technologies Corporation, which had emerged as the highest bidder in the earlier tender with a Rs 7200 crore bid. The state Housing Department, in its affidavit filed in reply to the petition, said a decision was taken to cancel the earlier tender and issue a fresh one with new conditions due to several factors, adding the financial and economic state of affairs in 2019 and in 2022 were materially different.  The present economic state of affairs is materially affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia-Ukraine war, uncertainty over Rupee-USD rate, interest rate volatility and overall high-risk perception of common investor,  the affidavit said. Hence, the government took a bonafide decision after obtaining legal advice to cancel the tender and float a new tender in public interest. The first tender for the redevelopment project was issued in November 2018, and bids were opened in March 2019. In the same month, an additional 45 acres was made available to the government by the Railways for the redevelopment project, the affidavit said. The Housing Department's affidavit claimed there was no formation of contract between the government and the petitioner company and, hence, it (company) has no legal right.  The petitioner has no vested right to get an award in a tender process. Any person who submits a bid can only legitimately expect his bid is considered in a non-arbitrary and transparent manner. No person has a right to do business with the government as a matter of right,  it said. The affidavit said the first tender dated 28 November, 2018 was cancelled by a government resolution (GR) dated November 5, 2020 as there was material change in the tender condition after the  bid due date . The affidavit also termed the petitioner's allegations of the government having acted arbitrarily to favour the selected bidder (Adani) as  vague and ambiguous , adding the old tender and the new one were different and could not be compared. In the new tender, the bids were to be submitted afresh and the petitioner could have taken part as there was no question of excluding anyone's participation, it said. Senior counsel Abhinav Chandrachud and advocates Suresh Iyer and Jenil Shah, appearing for the petitioner company, argued it had bid Rs 7200 crore, while the highest bid in the second tender (Adani) was Rs 5,069 crore. A division bench of Acting Chief Justice S V Gangapurwala and Justice Sandeep Marne on Friday said it would hear the plea on March 14.",

        "description": "Later Friday, the Pentagon acknowledged reports of a second balloon flying over Latin America.  We now assess it is another Chinese surveillance balloon,  Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement, declining to offer further information such as where it was spotted.",
        "datePublished": "2023-02-04T08:16:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "A huge, high-altitude Chinese balloon sailed across the U.S. on Friday, drawing severe Pentagon accusations of spying on sensitive military sites despite China's firm denials. Secretary of State Antony Blinken abruptly canceled a high-stakes Beijing trip aimed at easing U.S.-China tensions. Aside from the government response, fuzzy videos dotted social media as people with binoculars and telephoto lenses tried to find the  spy balloon  in the sky as it headed southeastward over Kansas and Missouri at 60,000 feet (18,300 meters). It was spotted earlier over Montana, which is home to one of America's three nuclear missile silo fields at Malmstrom Air Force Base, defense officials said. Later Friday, the Pentagon acknowledged reports of a second balloon flying over Latin America.  We now assess it is another Chinese surveillance balloon,  Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement, declining to offer further information such as where it was spotted. The U.S. actually had been tracking the initial balloon since at least Tuesday, when President Joe Biden was first briefed, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. According to three U.S. officials, Biden was initially inclined to order the surveillance balloon to be blown out of the sky, and a senior defense official said the U.S. had prepared fighter jets, including F-22s, to shoot it down if ordered.  The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, strongly advised Biden against shooting down the balloon, warning that its size - as big as three school buses - and considerable weight could create a debris field large enough to endanger Americans on the ground. The Pentagon also assessed that after unspecified U.S. measures, the possibility of the balloon uncovering important information was not great. It was not the first time Chinese surveillance balloons have been tracked over U.S. territory, including at least once during former President Donald Trump's administration, officials said. Blinken's trip cancellation came despite China's claim that the balloon was merely a weather research  airship  that had blown off course. The Pentagon rejected that out of hand - as well as China's contention that the balloon was not being used for surveillance and had only limited navigational ability. Blinken, who had been due to depart Washington for Beijing late Friday, said he had told senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi in a phone call that sending the balloon over the U.S. was  an irresponsible act and that (China's) decision to take this action on the eve of my visit is detrimental to the substantive discussions that we were prepared to have.  China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement Saturday morning:  In actuality, the U.S. and China have never announced any visit. The U.S. making any such announcement is their own business, and we respect that.  According to Beijing, Wang said China  has always strictly followed international law, we do not accept any groundless speculation and hype. Faced with unexpected situations, both parties need to keep calm, communicate in a timely manner, avoid misjudgments and manage differences.  After passing the sensitive military sites in Montana, the balloon was moving southeastward over the heartland of the central United States during the day and was expected to remain in U.S. airspace for several days, officials said. The development dealt a new blow to already strained U.S.-Chinese relations that have been in a downward spiral for years over numerous issues. Still, U.S. officials maintained that diplomatic channels remain open and Blinken said he remained willing to travel to China  when conditions allow.   We continue to believe that having open lines of communication is important,  he said. Biden declined to comment on the matter when questioned at an economic event. Two likely 2024 reelection challengers, Trump, and Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador, said the U.S. should immediately shoot down the balloon. Several Republican congressmen said the same, and a number blasted the administration for  allowing  the balloon intrusion.  The idea that Communist China has a spy balloon headed towards Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri right now - the home of the Stealth Bomber - is absolutely unbelievable,  said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo.  No American should accept this. I don't.  Jean-Pierre did not shed light on why the administration waited until Thursday to make its concerns public. Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, refused to say Friday whether there was any new consideration of shooting the balloon down. He said it currently was posing no threat. Ryder said it was maneuverable, not just at the mercy of the wind, and had changed course. Still, weather experts said China's claim that the balloon had gone off course was not unfeasible. China's account of wind patterns known as the Westerlies carrying a balloon to the western United States was  absolutely possible - not possible, likely,  said Dan Jaffe, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of Washington. As for Blinken's trip, Jean-Pierre said a diplomatic visit to China was not appropriate at such a time. She said that  the presence of this balloon in our airspace ... is a clear violation of our sovereignty as well as international law and it is unacceptable this occurred.  A State Department official said Blinken and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman had both protested to the top official at the Chinese Embassy on Wednesday, a day before the Pentagon announced the discovery of the balloon. Blinken's long-anticipated meetings with senior Chinese officials had been seen in both countries as a possible way to find some areas of common ground at a time of major disagreements over Taiwan, human rights, China's claims in the South China Sea, North Korea, Russia's war in Ukraine, trade policy and climate change. Although the trip, which was agreed to in November by Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit in Indonesia, had not been formally announced, officials in both Beijing and Washington had spoken in recent days about Blinken's imminent arrival for meetings on Sunday and Monday. China, which angrily denounces surveillance attempts by the U.S. and others over areas it considers to be its territory and once forced down an American spy plane and held its crew captive on Hainan Island, was relatively conciliatory in its response to the U.S. complaints. In a statement that approached an apology, the Chinese foreign ministry said the balloon was a civilian airship used mainly for meteorological research. It said said the airship had limited  self-steering  capabilities and had  deviated far from its planned course  because of winds.   The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into U.S. airspace due to force majeure,  the statement said, citing a legal term used to refer to events beyond one's control.",

        "datePublished": "2023-01-20T17:06:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "The government on Friday made it mandatory for social media influencers to disclose their  material  interest in endorsing products and services and violations can attract strict legal action, including ban on endorsements. The regulations are part of continuing efforts to curb misleading advertisements as well protect the interests of consumers amid the expanding social influencer market which is projected to be worth around Rs 2,800 crore by 2025. The new guidelines named 'Endorsement Know Hows -- for celebrities, influencers and virtual media influencers (Avatar or computer generated character) on social media platforms' has been issued by the Department of Consumers Affairs. In case of violation, the penalty prescribed for misleading advertisement under the Consumer Protection Act 2019 will be applicable. The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) can impose penalty of up to Rs 10 lakh on manufacturers, advertisers and endorsers. For subsequent offences, penalty of up to Rs 50 lakh can be imposed. The authority can prohibit endorser of a misleading ad from making any endorsement for up to 1 year and for subsequent contravention, prohibition can extend up to 3 years. Launching these guidelines at a press conference, Consumer Affairs Secretary Rohit Kumar Singh said the guidelines have been issued under the ambit of the consumer law that provides framework for the protection of consumers against unfair trade practices and misleading advertisements. He hoped that the guidelines would act as a deterrent for social media influencers.  It's a very important subject. The size of social influencer market in India in 2022 was of the order of Rs 1,275 crore and by 2025, it is likely to rise to Rs 2,800 crore with a compound annual growth rate of about 19-20 per cent. The social media influencer of substance, those having good number of followers, are in excess of 1 lakh in the country,  Singh said. Stating that the social media influencing is here to stay and will only grow exponentially, he said social influencers need to behave responsibly.  The today's guidelines are aimed at social media influencers which have material connection with the brand they want to promote on various social media platforms. This is an obligation for them to behave responsibly as far as the disclosure is concerned to the consumers.  One of the biggest paradigm of the consumer law is the consumers right to know and this falls in that purview. Consumers should know if something is thrown at him from digital media, the person or the entity which is sponsoring it have they taken money or any form of connection they have with the brand,  Singh said. The secretary said if non-compliance takes place, there are provisions under the law for people to approach the authority to seek legal action against people who are defaulting.  These guidelines broadly define that framework as to how social media influencers should indulge in disclosure of their relationship with the brand,  the secretary said. CCPA Chief Commissioner Nidhi Khare noted that misleading Advertisements in any form, format or medium is prohibited by law. The new guidelines have specified who all need to disclose, when to disclose and how to disclose. Individuals/groups who have access to an audience and the power to affect their audiences' purchasing decisions or opinions about a product, service, brand or experience, because of the influencer's/celebrity's authority, knowledge, position, or relationship with their audience will have to disclose the material connection, as per the new norm. The disclosure should happen  when there is a material connection between an advertiser and celebrity/influencer that may affect the weight or credibility of the representation made by the celebrity/influencer , Khare said. She said the disclosure should be in such a manner that it is  hard to miss  and should be in simple language. The disclosures should be placed in the endorsement message in such a manner that they are clear, prominent and extremely hard to miss. Disclosures should not be mixed with a group of hashtags or links. In endorsement in a picture, disclosures should be superimposed over the image enough for viewers to notice. In video, disclosures should be placed in the video and not just in the description and they should be made in both audio and video format. In the case of live stream, disclosures should be displayed continuously and prominently during the entire stream. On limited space platforms like Twitter, terms such as 'XYZ Ambassador' (where XYZ is a brand) are also acceptable, she said. The secretary said that these guidelines are being issued under the overall ambit of Consumer Protection Act and one of the main underlining principle of the law is prevention of unfair trade practice.  There are many ways in which unfair trading practices take place, one of the important unfair trading practice is the menace of misleading advertisements, by trying to sell something which is not exactly as it is being portrayed in the ad.  While it has been ably handled in the conventional media -- which is TV, print and radio, the social and digital media platforms are turning out to be different ball game,  Singh said.",

Rules must be made in a way that the compliance burden is as less as possible on smaller players and newer entrants,\u201d noted a senior official. \u201cThere are only some aspects \u2014 such as the legality of content, service and excessive violence in games \u2014 which will be carefully monitored.\u201dThe Centre is also likely to suggest that states not ban online games outright but, instead, \u201cpenalise them\u201d only in cases of serious lapses.\u201cWe are looking to drop criminal and strict penal provisions so the industry is able to innovate and move ahead without any fear. Of course, proper guardrails will always be there,\u201d according to officials cited above, who said, \u201cThese will initially be our suggestion to the states.\u201dThe upcoming rules are likely to be similar to the Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code that was introduced in 2021 and reworked earlier this year.Maintaining ScrutinyGaming companies will also be asked to enforce strict know-your-customer norms \u2014 establishing the correct age of players\u2019 by verifying it with a government-issued identity card. Gaming intermediaries will also be required to conduct additional scrutiny of methods used to purchase in-game add-ons.For instance, if a credit or debit card is repeatedly used to purchase in-game additions or buy additional playing time, gaming companies can analyse these patterns to establish the probable age of the buyer, or if the card is being misused by a minor.\u201cThose aspects can be looked into. Of course, we will need to have more than adequate consultation on these issues,\u201d officials said.In August, ET reported that an inter-ministerial group tasked with drawing up a framework to regulate online gaming had suggested introducing daily and caps on the amount of money individual players spend in a game.However, gaming companies are contending that the \u201clevel of expenditure\u201d could vary from person to person. They also have inbuilt systems that follow the pattern of gaming and ask players\u2019 beforehand about the maximum amount they would want to spend per day or per session.\u201cBut there are no checks and balances in place to ascertain the maximum amount that can be spent. That will have to be looked at as well,\u201d a second official said.The seven-member inter-ministerial task force, which was set up in May, includes members from the Niti Aayog, secretaries from the ministry of home affairs, Department of Revenue, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, ministry of information and broadcasting as well as the MeitY secretary.",

        "articleBody": "China fails to realise that India actually manages Arunachal Pradesh legally while it merely claims it. As the Chinese way of saying it-  Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India , writes Amrita Jash, Assistant Professor at the Department of Geopolitics and International Relations at the Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) in Manipal in her report for Border Lens.The report also states that:  China rejects the McMahon Line, the boundary between China and India, which it calls  illegal  and  unacceptable , for the following reasons: first, the Sino-Indian boundary has never been properly demarcated; no treaty or agreement has been made between the Chinese Central Government and the government of India. Secondly, Beijing believes the McMahon Line to be an imperialist legacy.What is interesting to note though is that in 1960, Beijing accepted the McMahon Line, which China adamantly condemns in the case of Arunachal Pradesh, in order to settle the border dispute with Myanmar. Initially, China only laid claim to the Tawang region of Arunachal Pradesh. Since the 1980s, however, Beijing has started claiming all of Arunachal Pradesh as part of its 'South Tibet' territory. Chinese transgressions along the LAC and episodes of stand-offs are a common behavioural pattern demonstrated by China in asserting its sovereignty claims over Arunachal Pradesh,  writes Amrita Jash for Border Lens.Official Chinese maps have renamed some locations in Arunachal Pradesh. The Chinese Ministry of Aviation in December 2021, standardised the names of 15 locations in Arunachal Pradesh.China has also condemned the visit of Indian leaders and the Dalai Lama to Arunachal Pradesh. As in recent times, Beijing's objection was noted against Vice President M. Venkaiah Naidu's visit to Arunachal Pradesh in October 2021. China's opposition stands invalid given Arunachal Pradesh is a state of India, as the Ministry of External Affairs rightly posited:  Objecting to the visit of Indian leaders to a state of India does not stand to reason and understanding of the Indian people ,  writes Jash.Beijing also claims to have built 'Xiaokang' village models along the Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh, the author reported.Recently, it was reported that despite the recent Tawang face-off between the Indian and Chinese soldiers in the Yangtse area, the local villagers of Zemithang are not worried about such type of incident and they have full confidence in the Union government and the Indian Army and are certain that they will protect them.Zemithang with a population of about 5,000 is the last village in India. It is located in Arunachal Pradesh's Tawang district and is just 10 km away from the LAC.Zemithang is the last border village of Arunachal Pradesh along the Indo-China border.",

        "description": "Musk appears to be gearing up for legal battles at Twitter, which he purchased in October for $44 billion, according to seven people familiar with internal conversations.",
        "datePublished": "2022-12-14T16:14:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "Over the past two weeks, Elon Musk has shaken up Twitter's legal department, disbanded a council that advised the social media company on safety issues and is continuing to take drastic steps to cut costs. Musk appears to be gearing up for legal battles at Twitter, which he purchased in October for $44 billion, according to seven people familiar with internal conversations. He and his team have revamped Twitter's legal department and pushed out one of his closest advisers in the process. They have also instructed employees to not pay vendors in anticipation of potential litigation, the people said. To cut costs, Twitter has not paid rent for its San Francisco headquarters or any of its global offices for weeks, three people close to the company said. Twitter has also refused to pay a $197,725 bill for private charter flights made the week of Musk's takeover, according to a copy of a lawsuit filed in New Hampshire District Court and obtained by The New York Times. Twitter's leaders have also discussed the consequences of denying severance payments to thousands of people who have been laid off since the takeover, two people familiar with the talks said. And Musk has threatened employees with lawsuits if they talk to the media and  act in a manner contrary to the company's interest,  according to an internal email sent last Friday. The aggressive moves signal that Musk is still slashing expenditures and is bending or breaking Twitter's previous agreements to make his mark. His reign has been characterized by chaos, a series of resignations and layoffs, reversals of the platform's previous suspensions and rules, and capricious decisions that have driven away advertisers. Musk did not respond to a request for comment. As he has transitioned into the role of Twitter's new leader, Musk has had a cast of rotating legal professionals by his side. In October, he fired both Twitter's chief legal officer and general counsel  for cause  within hours of closing his acquisition and installed his personal lawyer, Alex Spiro, to head up legal and policy matters at the company. Spiro is no longer working at Twitter, according to six people familiar with the decision. Those people said that Musk has been unhappy with some decisions made by Spiro, a noted criminal defense lawyer who successfully defended the billionaire in a high-profile defamation case in late 2019 and worked his way into the Twitter owner's inner circle. Among those decisions was Spiro's call to retain Twitter's deputy general counsel, James A. Baker, through Musk's various rounds of layoffs and firings. Baker had served as general counsel at the FBI until May 2018 - advising the agency on politically fraught investigations into Hillary Rodham Clinton's private email server and Donald Trump's campaign - and joined Twitter in 2020. Last week, Musk said he terminated Baker after he learned that the lawyer had been responsible for reviewing internal communications about the company's decision to suppress a 2020 New York Post story about Hunter Biden's laptop. Musk had ordered that those communications, which he has called the  Twitter Files,  be given to a group of journalists to release and discredit the decision-making of the company's past executives. With Twitter drained of legal talent from layoffs and departures, Musk has sought lawyers from his other companies, including rocket maker SpaceX, to fill the void. More than half a dozen lawyers from the space exploration company have been given access to Twitter's internal systems, according to two people and documents seen by the Times. SpaceX employees who have been brought in to Twitter include Chris Cardaci, the company's vice president of legal, and Tim Hughes, its senior vice president, global business and government affairs. A SpaceX spokesperson did not return a request for comment. Among its legal challenges, Twitter is facing more questions from the Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating whether the company is still adhering to a consent decree. In 2011, the company signed a consent decree with the FTC after two data breaches and said it would not mislead users about privacy protection. In May, the company paid $150 million to the FTC and Justice Department to settle allegations that it had violated the terms of that consent decree, which was expanded. The FTC has sent Twitter letters asking whether it still has the resources and staff to adhere to the consent decree, two people with knowledge of the matter said. An FTC spokesperson declined to comment. On Friday, as Musk encouraged the release of internal information through the continuation of his Twitter Files, he also sent an email to employees noting  many detailed leaks of confidential Twitter information  showed that some were violating their nondisclosure agreements.  If you clearly and deliberately violate the NDA that you signed when joining Twitter, you accept liability to the full extent of the law and Twitter will immediately seek damages,  he wrote. The email was first reported by the Platformer newsletter. Musk's team has also deliberated the merits of not paying severance to the thousands of people who have left the company since he took over, when there were about 7,500 full-time employees. While Musk and his advisers had previously considered forgoing any severance when discussing cuts in late October, the company ultimately decided that U.S.-based employees would be given at least two months of pay and one month of severance pay so that the company would be compliant with federal and state labor laws. Musk's team is now reconsidering whether it should pay some of those months, according to two people familiar with the discussions, or just face lawsuits from disgruntled former employees. Many former employees still have not received any paperwork formalizing their separation from Twitter, five people said. Musk has already refused to pay millions of dollars in exit packages to executives he claims were terminated  for cause. ",

Lok Adalat is one of the alternative dispute redressal mechanisms. It is a forum where disputes/cases pending in the court of law or at pre-litigation stage are settled amicably. Lok Adalats have been given statutory status under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.   The groundwork for this exercise has already been initiated and all the consumer commissions have been intimated to identify cases that have an element of settlement and prepare a list of pending cases that can be referred to Lok Adalat,  senior Consumer Affairs Ministry official said.  Lok Adalat offers a convenient forum where disputes/cases pending in the commissions can be settled amicably, she said.  With the help of technology, a separate link has been created on the Department of Consumer Affairs' website and circulated amongst all stakeholders wherein one can enter their pending case number and commission where the case is pending and easily refer the matter to Lok Adalat.  The link has been circulated through e-mail and SMS. Till date, over 4,91,665 SMSs and 86,894 e-mails have been sent. A total of 2,910 consent has been received, the official said.  The department has also held a virtual meeting with the consumer commissions which had pending cases filed before 2000. The deliberations were also held with state and consumer organisations.

Senior advocate Devajit Saikia, her counsel, told PTI that the case has been filed at the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division) of Kamrup Metropolitan on Friday and it will be moved on September 26.  My client has claimed a defamation of Rs 10 crore against Gaurav Gogoi for various tweets on X. We have made it very clear that we never made any application to receive subsidy,  he added. Saikia further claimed that the process to seek subsidy has not been initiated at all and for which, a show cause notice was slapped on his client's firm on May 26 this year, followed by an email from the Ministry of Food Processing.  The approval for the project was given on November 22, 2022. In the last email, we were told that our claim would lapse if we didn't submit our proposal. We are not responding to anything to seek subsidy,  he added. Whatever Gogoi stated on social media about Sarma and her entity 'Pride East Entertainments', that information was not based on facts, claimed the senior advocate.  He (Gogoi) did not do his homework. Getting approval for a project does not mean that a subsidy has been received. We will fight the case tooth and nail,  he asserted. A huge controversy erupted after Guwahati-based digital media 'The Crosscurrent' published a report alleging that over 50 bigha (nearly 17 acres) of agricultural land at Darigaji village in Kaliabor in Nagaon district was reclassified as industrial land within a month after it was bought by Pride East Entertainments, in which the chief minister's wife is the chairman and managing director. Following this, Gogoi, in a series of tweets for several days, brought allegations of corruption against Sarma and his wife in getting central government subsidy for the project. The Deputy Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha sought the intervention of Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal in bringing facts out in the open regarding subsidy for the project under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) and Scheme for Creation of Infrastructure for Agro Clusters. The Assam MP also pointed out that on March 22, 2023, Goyal in a reply to questions in Lok Sabha on the government's initiative to invest in Assam in order to support the promotion of industries, provided a list of food processing projects supported under the component of PMKSY as on January 31, 2022.  At Serial No 7 of the list, the name of M/S Pride East Entertainment Pvt Ltd has been mentioned. Pertinently, the amount of approved Grant-in-Aid is mentioned as Rs 10 crore. The list of beneficiaries can also be found on the website of the Ministry of Food Processing Industries,  he added. The PM Kisan Sampada Yojana is a comprehensive package which aims to create modern infrastructure with efficient supply chain management from farm gate to retail outlet. Gogoi's claims were vehemently challenged by the chief minister, who was engaged in a prolonged duel with the Congress leader on X. His wife had threatened to sue the MP alleging defamation.",

The comments came after China's exports of germanium and gallium items plunged in August, the first month of the export controls customs data showed on Wednesday. That followed a surge in July exports of the two niche metals related to chip-making, when overseas buyers rushed to lock in supply before the curbs took effect. China unveiled curbs that month on exports of eight gallium and six germanium products, starting from August. It was the latest salvo of an escalating war between Beijing and Washington over access to materials used in making high-tech microchips. The new rules require exporters of germanium and gallium products to obtain an export licence for dual-use items and technologies, or those which have potential military and civilian uses. The commerce ministry said it had received some applications for the export licence in the middle of August. China's exports of wrought germanium stood at 36.48 metric tons in the first eight months of 2023, up 58% from the year-earlier period, while shipments of wrought gallium fell 58% on the year to 22.72 tons over the period from January to August.",

Summers highlighted the importance of factors such as promoting free market forces, addressing infrastructure needs, and implementing reforms in key states. ",

        "articleBody": "India must aim to and can potentially grow at 8% annually to herald transformative changes in the lives of millions of people by around 2050 and such an expansion rate is an  imaginable goal  for the country, renowned economist and former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said on Saturday. Summers co-chairs the Independent Expert Group on strengthening MDB reforms.He said a combination of factors, including promoting free market forces, addressing infrastructure needs- particularly in energy -and undertaking reforms in key states, could catapult India into the high-growth trajectory. The state of the global economy, too, would be an important factor in shaping India's growth story, he added.India's economic growth will likely touch 6.5% in FY24, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) forecast, against 7.2% a year earlier. It aims to be a developed nation by 2047.Summers was in the national capital to deliver a lecture on The World is on Fire, organised by industry body CII and the Department of Economic Affairs. He also stressed the existence of a number of barriers that impinge on India's growth, which include issues between the Union and state governments. AI could help drive up India's growth, he said, as it's an area in which the country sees a possibility to shine.Summers exuded confidence that  higher for longer  interest rate regime across key economies is unlikely to be a major barrier to world growth. Earlier this week, the US Federal Reserve decided to keep the fed funds rate in a targeted range of 5.25-5.5%, the highest in about 22 years.Summers said he didn't forecast the 8% growth on the basis of the current policies but  given India's potential, even in a more challenging world economy, I believe that it is an imaginable goal,  he said.  I think it is something to target as India defines its greatness in this next century. He voiced concerns over growing protectionism across the globe, suggesting that it doesn't really help make an economy resilient.  The important thing to understand about resilience is that resilience comes much more from diversity than it comes from self-reliance.  Excessive dependence on single-source supply exposes an economy to a great deal of risks, he indicated.In his lecture, Summers, who co-chaired an independent group under India's G20 presidency on reforms of multilateral development banks (MDBs) along with 15th Finance Commission chairman NK Singh, spoke extensively on the need for climate mitigation measures and the role of the MDBs. The MDBs must be nurtured in a way that they emerge not just as quantitatively bigger but qualitatively better, he added.Speaking on the occasion, DEA secretary Ajay Seth said the New Delhi declaration of the G20 leaders this month strongly pitched for bigger, better and more effective MDBs with a stronger financing capacity in which Global South would have a greater representation. Chief economic advisor V Anantha Nageswaran also attended the lecture.",

        "description": "The Indian finance ministry has stated that economic activities in the second quarter of this fiscal year are progressing well, following the momentum seen in the previous quarter. However, it has expressed concerns about the recent increase in global crude oil prices. The report also highlights the potential risks of a stock market correction and geopolitical developments on investment sentiment in the second half of the financial year. Despite these risks, the ministry remains optimistic due to positive factors such as corporate profitability, private sector investment, and bank credit growth.",

The risks will be offset by the \u201cbright spots\u201d of corporate profitability, private sector capital formation, bank credit growth and activity in the construction sector.\u201cIn sum, we remain comfortable with our 6.5% real GDP growth estimate for FY24 with symmetric risks,\u201d the report said.The strong advance tax collections for the second quarter of FY24 suggest the private sector is in good health and that \u201cthey are investing\u201d, it added.The deleveraging and restructuring of the balance sheet have placed companies in a sound position to bolster investment and become more resilient to economic shocks, while banks remain healthier than before and are in a position to satiate the rising credit appetite of the economy, the report said, explaining the optimism behind the ministry\u2019s assessment.Growth momentum for private non-financial companies continued from the March quarter into the first quarter of FY24. The business sentiments remain upbeat, as indicated by RBI\u2019s Quarterly Enterprise Surveys, it added.Retail inflation dropped to 6.83% in August from a 15-month high of 7.44% in the previous month, as core inflation dropped to a 40-month low. Prices of selected food items that drove the inflation rate above 7% in July are on the retreat, the report said. The report attributed the moderation in inflation to \u201ccalibrated measures\u201d taken by the government, including adjustments in the duties of critical inputs and the monetary policy tightening. Targeted measures for specific crops, including build-up of buffers, procurement from producing centres and subsidised distribution, weighed down food inflation, it added.The report expected a moderation in bond yields as inflationary concerns have started to abate. The government\u2019s commitment to fiscal prudence will also aid in keeping G-sec yields in check, it added.Outlook for both the manufacturing and services sectors remains positive, the report said, citing surveys by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).Meanwhile, organised sector employment indicated healthy growth, including a rise in new members joining Employee Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) and more members rejoining than exiting the social security net, it said.Apart from facilitating the formalisation of labour, the government has also taken major steps to secure the future of unorganised workers through minimum guaranteed pension under Atal Pension Yojana, PM-SYM etc., forming an expansive social security net woven in recent years, the report said. This two-pronged approach of formalisation and social security for informal workers \u201cexemplifies a sustainable approach to long-term inclusive growth\u201d, it added.",

Yields jumped after the Fed on Wednesday forecast fewer rate cuts in 2024 than it previously expected and said it may hike rates this year one more time as it battles to bring inflation closer to its 2% annual target. The projections appeared to reflect confidence in a still strong economy. The Fed nearing the end of its tightening cycle is also boosting growth expectations.  With the Fed out of the way, no longer actively putting the brakes on the economy, long term yields clearly could rise,  said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.

The inversion in the yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes was last at minus 65 basis points. Fed funds futures traders are pricing in a less than 50% chance of an additional rate increase, while the first cut is now seen as likely in July.

The ministry's Monthly Economic Review for August highlighted the 7.8% growth in Q1 2023, driven by domestic demand, consumption, and investment. Risks such as rising crude oil prices and monsoon deficit were noted, but the review stated that the rains in September have helped reduce the rainfall deficit. ",

The ministry's August edition of Monthly Economic Review said the 7.8 per cent growth recorded in the first quarter (April-June) was on account of strong domestic demand, consumption and investment. The growth was also witnessed in various high-frequency indicators.  Flagging certain risks like steadily climbing crude oil prices in the global market, impact of monsoon deficit in August on Kharif and Rabi crops, the review said,  that needs to be assessed.  At the same time, it observed, the rains in September have erased a portion of the rainfall deficit at the end of August.  Furthermore, the review said, a stock market correction, in the wake of an overdue global stock market correction, is an ever present risk, and offsetting these risks are the bright spots of corporate profitability, private sector capital formation, bank credit growth and activity in the construction sector.   In sum, we remain comfortable with our 6.5 per cent real GDP growth estimate for FY24 with symmetric risks,  it said.  Observing that the strength of domestic investment is the result of the government's continued emphasis on capital expenditure, the report said, measures implemented by the central government have also incentivised states to increase their capex spending.  The external demand has further complemented the domestic growth stimulus, it said, adding, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth has increased in Q1FY24, as services exports have performed well.  High Frequency Indicators (HFIs) for July/August 2023 reflect sustenance of growth momentum in Q2FY24, it said.  With regard to the banking sector, it said, a variety of indicators suggest increasing resilience of the sector through declining Non-Performing Assets (NPA), improving Capital to Risk-weighted Asset Ratio (CRAR), rising Return on Assets (RoA) and Return on Equity (RoE) as of March 2023.  Similarly, as of March 2023, data for Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) indicated improvements in their profitability and risk-taking behaviour, it said.  Further, it said, as per the July 2023 estimates by the RBI, there has been a consistent and broad-based growth in the non-food bank credit of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) since April 2022.  On retail inflation, the report said, it decreased in August, with both core inflation and food inflation easing from the July figure.  The calibrated measures taken by the government, including adjustments in the duties of many critical inputs and monetary policy tightening, helped reduce core inflation to a 40-month low level. Globally, food inflation remains high in many major economies, it said.  In India, it said, consumer food price inflation eased to 9.9 per cent in August due to the government intervention with targeted measures for specific crops, including build-up of buffer, procurement from producing centres and subsidised distribution.",

As of August, consumer food price inflation eased to 9.9 per cent from 11.5 per cent in July. Vegetable inflation, however, surged in both July and August due to various factors including a sudden price rise in tomatoes and other food items, due to crop specific and weather-related factors like rain deficiency in the country. Nonetheless, the average inflation during April-August 2023, was 5.6 per cent, which is within the RBI tolerance limit of 2-6 per cent.   103856876Meanwhile, the economy's outlook report highlighted that the monsoon deficit in August could impact both Kharif and Rabi crops which requires assessment. However, it is a relief that the monsoon deficit of August has been partially plugged in September, the report added.

But, no alarms yet,  it said. Oil prices hovered near 10-month highs this week, as a bigger-than-expected draw in US oil stockpiles along with weak US shale output reinforcing fears of tight crude supply for the rest of 2023.Global benchmark Brent crude futures climbed 6 cents, or 0.1%, to $94.40 a barrel on September 20, staying near the highest since November of $95.96 hit on the previous day.Earlier this week, industry data showed U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell last week by about 5.25 million barrels, Reuters reported. As per a Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. rejoined the $100-a-barrel oil club, raising its forecast for crude back to triple digits as worldwide demand hits unprecedented levels and OPEC+ supply curbs continue to tighten the market.The DEA's outlook remains bright for FY24 amid continued momentum in economic activity.

        "articleBody": "India will be a USD 5 trillion economy and the third largest in the world by market exchange rates by 2027, aided by the demographic advantage and pace of financial sector development, Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Michael D Patra has said. Delivering a speech at the 16th SEACEN-BIS High-Level Seminar hosted by the National Bank of Cambodia on Monday, Patra said it is widely believed that during the next two decades -- if not for longer -- the centre of gravity of the global economy will shift eastward to Asia. The IMF's Regional Economic Outlook for Asia and the Pacific indicates that this region will contribute about two-thirds of global growth in 2023 itself and India will account for a sixth of world output growth in 2023 and 2024, he said. In terms of market exchange rates, he said India is the fifth-largest economy in the world and the third-largest economy on the basis of purchasing power parity.  Our assessment is that by 2027, India will be a USD 5 trillion economy and the third largest in the world even by market exchange rates. A key driver in this transformation is likely to be the window of a demographic dividend that opened up in 2018 and will probably last till the 2040s, going by fertility and mortality rates,  Patra said.  We are the most populous country in the world at 1.4 billion and the youngest at an average age of 28 years. The other major catalyst of India's progress will be the pace and quality of financial sector development, which is the theme of my address today,  he said. For a high saving rate economy, like the rest of Asia, he said, a modern, efficient, and soundly functioning financial sector is essential for mobilising the resource requirements of India's developmental aspirations. While the jury is still out on whether economic progress is finance or demand-led, Patra said a wealth of empirical evidence points to Asia's growth trajectory being that of the real economy leading financial development, and India is no exception. There is also stylised evidence that the composition of the financial sector across Asia is changing, with hitherto bank-dominated systems giving space to alternative financial intermediaries like non-banks and capital markets, he said, adding these developments, in turn, generate impulses of growth for the rest of the economy. In India, he said, additional dimensions have opened up exciting possibilities for leveraging our growth potential - the digital revolution; transformation of the payment and settlement ecosystem; and innovations in financial inclusion.  More recently, India's exponential expansion of the usage of space technology is reshaping every aspect of our lives, including the financial sector,  he said. The approach to the financial sector in India is reflecting a new paradigm in which macroeconomic and financial stability are seen as strongly complementary and providing the foundation for medium-term growth prospects, Patra noted. Prudence is taking precedence over-exuberance, and this is reflected in the steady build-up of all types of buffers, he pointed out.  In an overarching sense, this approach is reflected in the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, which, as our experience has shown, has become our national safety net in the absence of a truly global financial shield. Besides providing the wherewithal to protect our financial markets and institutions from being overwhelmed by global spillovers, the reserves have helped to build bulwarks of external strength, as reflected in modest external debt servicing and debt to GDP ratios,  he said.  We believe that this is strengthening our capability to manage new challenges, such as climate change and cyber threats while maintaining public confidence and ensuring the financing requirements of India's development strategy,  he added.",

U.S. GDP expanded at a 2.4% annualized rate in the second quarter, and some estimates put the current quarter's pace at more than twice that. The robust U.S. economy has defied an aggressive campaign of Fed rate hikes over the past 18 months, creating a conundrum for policy makers. Yellen did not specify what she regards as the U.S. economy's potential growth rate, except to say that it has been growing above potential since it raced out of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday are due to reveal a policy decision widely expected to keep rates on hold for now, but also flagging in new economic projections whether they feel rates still need to rise further before the end of the year to bring inflation back to their 2% annual target. Yellen said that pressure was coming out of the labor market, with demand for labor softening, which was helping to bring down core inflation. Surveys of companies showed that difficulty in hiring workers had abated, job opening are down and the  quit rate  of workers leaving for higher paying positions was lower - all healthy signs for the labor market. Yellen said she saw a lower risk that a recent rise in oil and gasoline prices would trigger a rise in inflationary expectation, because core inflation was lower  The Fed has been focused on that, we're in a somewhat safer environment with low inflation,  Yellen said. CHINA SPILLOVERS On China, Yellen said she expected Chinese authorities to use their fiscal and monetary policy space to avoid a major slowdown of its economy, and this would help limit spillovers to the U.S. economy.  There could be spillovers. I wouldn't rule it out,  Yellen said. China, the world's second-largest economy, has lost steam since the second quarter and showed only tentative signs of stabilization last month with policy support. It has sought to court foreign capital as its economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic slows in the face of tepid overseas demand and property weakness.  I think the Chinese would most likely use the policy space they have to try to avoid a slowdown with major proportions,  she added. ",

Experts indicate that inflation will likely decline further in September, but risks from El Nino remain. OECD, an intergovernmental group of 38 high-income economies, was more pessimistic about the future, downgrading India\u2019s forecast by a full percentage point to 6% from 7% projected in the June outlook. The international organisation raised the FY25 inflation outlook upwards as well to 4.8% from 4.2%.\u201cInflation could continue to prove more persistent than projected, with further disruptions to energy and food markets still possible,\u201d OECD said, noting the turmoil across economies.While the international body batted for restrictive monetary policy to abate inflationary pressures, it pointed out that some countries, including India, could go for easing next year.\u201cThere is scope for some modest policy easing over the next year in all of these economies, provided inflation pressures remain well contained,\u201d it said, pointing out to India, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa.Reserve Bank of India is likely to hold the policy rate at 6.5% in its upcoming meeting in April, with most experts pencilling in a hike next fiscal. RBI expects 6.5% growth and 5.4% inflation in FY24.On Monday, S&P Global Market Intelligence raised India\u2019s growth forecast for FY24 to 6.6% while also revising inflation forecast upward to 6% for 2023.Global growth concernsThe global growth outlook also received a fillip by 0.3 percentage points in 2023 to 3%, whereas next year\u2019s number was revised downward to 2.7%.Euro area and China both witnessed a downward revision in growth outlook for 2023 and 2024.\u201cA further slowdown in China would dampen growth in trading partners worldwide and could drag down business confidence,\u201d it said.OECD also cautioned against elevated levels of public debt in some economies and rallied for more efficient allocation of resources to combat climate change.\u201c\u2026in order to lay the groundwork for stronger and more sustainable growth longer term, policy action is needed to enhance competition, accelerate investment in low-carbon research and development and reduce rather than increase trade barriers,\u201d said OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann.",

More than 200 samples from high-risk contacts have tested negative. All four patients under treatment are stable, and the condition of a nine-year-old boy, who was on ventilator support, is improving. ",

        "articleBody": "The situation regarding the latest Nipah outbreak in Kerala is completely under control, and more than 200 samples from the high-risk contacts were tested negative, Kerala Health Minister Veena George said here on Monday. In an interview with PTI, the minister said so far 1,233 contacts have been traced and categorised into high-risk and low-risk contacts.  A very positive thing is that all four patients under treatment are now stable, and the condition of the nine-year-old boy, who was on ventilator support, is improving clinically. He is now out of ventilator support and is being given minimal oxygen support,  George said. A round-the-clock control room and 19 teams on the field have helped in the strict implementation of the protocol, bringing things under control, she said.  So far, we have six positive cases, and all the samples tested for the last three days were negative,  the minister said. The Central teams who have been working with the Kerala health department have expressed their appreciation for the work the department has done to effectively contain the outbreak. 103766141 They (the Central team members) sit in all discussions. Our team leaders will explain every day in the convergence meeting how a contact, which is very important, a very high-risk contact was identified. So the Central teams have really appreciated our work,  George said. Three Central teams, one from ICMR, one from NIV, Pune, and one from the Epidemiological Institute, Chennai are in Kerala. They had earlier visited the containment zones and Nipah epicentre in 2018 and have also conducted bat surveillance. The system responded very well as per the protocol and guidelines, which were twice modified in 2021 and then in 2023, in the treatment and containment of Nipah, the minister said.  Primarily, we are giving antiviral medicines like Remdesivir. The dosages for infants and adults are all well written. The protocol is being followed by both government and private hospitals,  George said. Understanding the vulnerability of Kozhikode to the disease outbreak, a strict protocol has been followed since 2018.  We have set up a testing lab at the Medical College, Kozhikode. In August this year, we tested 35 samples for the Nipah virus. This year, hundreds of samples were tested. If anyone has encephalitis, then that sample will be sent for testing for Nipah,  the minister said. The system has always been on high alert, and a diagnosis protocol was ready. Many studies have been conducted in Kozhikode from 2018 onwards including bat surveillance, she said.  We are on constant alert, constant vigil, that will continue, and integration of some departments, like we have developed a  one health programme  in Kerala based on our experiences on Nipah. Because this is an era of zoonotic diseases, we cannot stay away from the concept of  one health  and it is only the state of Kerala that has developed that concept,  George said.  One health  is a programme launched by the state health department where all the concerned departments will get a platform for convergence in fighting against infectious diseases outbreak. The minister said for better convergence of departments in case of any infectious disease outbreak, the government is planning to set up a One Health Institute in Kozhikode. Asked about restrictions for anyone visiting Kerala or Kozhikode, she said there is no travel ban.  See, we have a protocol; according to our guidelines, when a Nipah case is reported, the area within the five-kilometre radius is declared as a containment zone. There is movement restriction only in that particular area,  George said. She said not even the whole of Kozhikode district is affected, but only few wards. Terming contact tracing as very challenging, George said many people do not admit that they were in contact with the positive patient initially. So when health workers called up, they were reluctant to admit the places they visited.  For example, if a patient visits a hospital, it is easier for us to get the details of other patients and also the list of health workers. But some patients may have more than one bystander, and we may not know that,  George said. She said these people later admitted their presence after a counselling session. To handle such cases, the Kerala government sought the help of the police department to confirm the location through mobile tower analysis. The health minister said that in none of the previous outbreaks, the entire contact list could be traced. The total number of cases of Nipah infection confirmed in the state are six, of which two persons have died and four persons are being treated. The World Health Organisation and ICMR studies have found that the entire state, not just Kozhikode, is prone to such infections.",

The treatment using a monoclonal antibody is only 50-60% effective, but a more efficient version is being developed. ",

        "articleBody": "The Kerala government on Sunday said the Nipah outbreak in the state is under control as there were no new positive cases for the second consecutive day and that the already infected patients were getting better. State Health Minister Veena George said it was a big relief for the state that no new fresh positive cases of the virus have been detected.  The situation is under control presently,  she said. The minister was speaking to reporters here in the evening after a review of the Nipah situation in this north Kerala district of the state. George said the four infected persons, including a nine-year-old boy, were getting better and the child has been taken off ventilator for the time being. Regarding the treatment using a monoclonal antibody, the only experimental therapeutic available to the government against the virus, the minister said the present variant was only 50-60 per cent effective and that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has assured that it will get a new and more efficient version. She also said that samples from 36 bats have been taken and sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune to ascertain the presence of the virus among the mammals. George further said that since all the infected persons got the virus from the same person -- the index case -- who died on August 30, it was clear that there was no second wave and that it was welcome news.  It can also be proved through genomic sequencing which is being carried out,  she said. So far, 1,233 contacts have been traced and of them 352 are in the high-risk category, she said. Earlier in the day, the minister said that as no new positive Nipah cases were being reported, the containment and quarantine measures would remain in place for 42 days from the last positive case reported. The incubation period of the virus is 21 days and therefore,  a double incubation period of 42 days from the last positive case  is considered as the period during which caution has to be exercised, George explained In the morning, she also said that a central team was surveying the area of the 2018 Nipah outbreak and will look for any ecological changes there, while teams from NIV Pune and ICMR are also carrying out field surveys in the district. State Tourism Minister P A Mohamed Riyas, who was also part of the press briefing, said that people were cooperating very well with the government's containment and quarantine efforts. George, in a statement, also said that the state was well equipped to carry out Nipah testing and can also confirm the presence of the virus through the tests. The mobile labs of Rajiv Gandhi Center for Biotechnology and NIV Pune have also helped to expedite testing and strengthen preventive measures, she said. Giving details of the testing process, the minister said the procedure is complicated due to the dangerous nature of the virus. At the same time, persons infected with Nipah do not show symptoms in the initial stages, which is a challenge as early testing is critical to increase the chances of survival and prevent the spread of the disease. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) or PCR tests are used to detect the Nipah virus, she said. Meanwhile, the state government has launched a special out patient department (OPD) service in connection with Nipah under its e-Sanjeevini telemedicine system, Kozhikode District Collector A Geetha had said in a Facebook post. In her post, Geetha also advised people against frightening bats by throwing stones at them or making loud noises by bursting firecrackers, setting fire to their roots and cutting down trees they inhabit. The Collector said that when bats infected with Nipah are harmed, frightened or moved from their habitat, the level of the virus in their body increases due to stress. As a result, the viruses will be expelled through body fluids and this will increase the risk of spread of the infection, she said. The total number of cases of Nipah infection confirmed in the state are six, of which two persons have died and four persons are being treated. The World Health Organisation and ICMR studies have found that the entire state, not just Kozhikode, is prone to such infections.",

        "articleBody": "Optimum delivery of health schemes to every intended beneficiary, including those in the last mile, will lead to achieving the goal of Universal health coverage, President Droupadi Murmu said on Wednesday. Launching the 'Ayushman Bhavah' campaign, Murmu said it is a comprehensive nationwide healthcare initiative that aims to provide saturation coverage of healthcare services in every village and town in the country.  I have been told that multi-ministerial approach is being taken to implement the programme. To achieve such a big target everyone's cooperation is critical,  the president said.  No person should be left behind and no village should be left behind i.e. 100 per cent people can avail health services. This goal will make our country successful in achieving the objective of Universal health coverage in true sense,  the President said. The prime minister has given central importance to Mahatma Gandhi's idea of 'Antyodaya' in his activities. This campaign to provide health services to the last person in the last village is inspired by the ideal of 'Antyodaya', the president said. The president noted that during the G20 meeting members nations put forth a clear road map for the G20 2023 action plan for accelerating progress on the sustainable development goals.  The government of India has set localised sustainable development goals in order to achieve the UN's SDG 2030. Under this, a major focus is on development works at the rural level,  she said. Village panchayats that successfully saturate the health schemes will earn the prestigious title of 'Ayushman Gram Panchayat' or 'Ayushman Urban Ward,' symbolising their dedication to equitable healthcare provision, she said. The campaign, which has been launched on Tuesday, will be implemented during the 'Seva Pakhwada' starting from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday on September 17 and continue till October 2, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said. The campaign is a collaborative effort spearheaded by gram panchayats in coordination with the Department of Health, other government departments, and local elected bodies in rural and urban areas.  Its core objective is to extend comprehensive healthcare coverage to every village and town, transcending geographical barriers and ensuring that no one is left behind,  the minister said. This synergistic approach aims to saturate coverage of health services through its three components -- Ayushman-Apke Dwar 3.0, Ayushman Melas at Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) and Community Health Centres (CHCs) and Ayushman Sabhas in every village and panchayat. Through the Ayushman Apke Dwar 3.0, initiative the government aims to provide Ayushman cards to remaining eligible beneficiaries enrolled under the PM-JAY scheme, ensuring that more individuals have access to essential health services. Ayushman Melas at HWCs and CHCs will facilitate the creation of ABHA IDs (Health IDs) and issuance of Ayushman Bharat Cards. They will also offer early diagnosis, comprehensive primary health care services, tele-consultation with specialists, and appropriate referrals, Mandaviya said. Under the Ayushman Sabhas, gatherings in every village and panchayat will play a pivotal role in distributing Ayushman cards, generating ABHA IDs, and raising awareness about vital health schemes and disease conditions, such as non-communicable diseases, tuberculosis. sickle cell disease, as well as blood donation and organ donation drives. The Ayushman Bhavah campaign is aligned with the vision of creating 'Healthy Villages' and 'Healthy Gram Panchayats,' laying the foundation for achieving Universal Health Coverage in the country.",

The Act also mandates the authority to have independent domain experts, patient representatives, care givers and NGO apart from ex-officio government members.",
        "datePublished": "2023-09-11T19:44:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "Lt Governor VK Saxena has approved setting up State Mental Health Authority, pointing out a delay of around five years on the part of Delhi government in constituting the panel for it, officials at LG office said on Monday. No immediate reaction was available from Delhi government over the allegation of delay in constitution of the Authority.  The Central Mental Health Care Act, 2017 mandates setting up of State Mental Health Authority (SMHA) for the welfare of patients with mental illness. The Act also mandates the authority to have independent domain experts, patient representatives, care givers and NGO apart from ex-officio government members.   Delhi is yet to have its SMHA. The Delhi government, under pressure from the Centre, finally moved a proposal to constitute Delhi SMHA after a delay of 5 years, only with ex-officio members,  officials said.  The LG while giving approval to the proposal  slammed government apathy  in the matter and directed it to immediately initiate the process of appointing independent domain experts, representatives of patients and care givers, as well as NGOs to the authority, they said.  In his noting on the file for approval to SMHA, the LG pointed that the authority was to be set up within nine months of the enactment of Mental Health Care Act 2017 with nod by the President.  The Act stipulates that the SMHA will have one each of an independent and eminent psychiatrist, mental health professional, psychiatrist social worker, clinical psychologist, mental health nurse (all with 15 years' experience), as well as two representatives each of patients, care givers and NGOs, according to the LG's office.  Such wide representation in SMHA was obviously aimed at covering all aspects of mental health care so that it functions as a dynamic body and not just another bureaucratic regulator, he said in the file note.   In the light of the above, it is surprising that the proposal for constitution of SMHA, after a lapse of more than 5 years since the enactment of the Act in 2017, has been put up now and that too, comprising only of ex-officio members,  Saxena noted on the file.  This  cavalier approach  exhibited by the Health department in the constitution of such an important statutory authority is  deeply disconcerting,  the LG observed.  The proposal for SMHA was approved by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Health minister Saurabh Bhardwaj before seeking nod of the LG on it.   What is even more concerning is that it took the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, to request through its communication dated August 29, 2022, to take early actions in establishing SMHA, for the Delhi government to be shaken out of its inertia,  said the LG.  Even then Delhi government  did not care to expedite  such statutorily warranted action, and the proposal kept pending before the Health minister for almost four and half months, he said.   I am constrained to flag this lackadaisicalness and expect that the Chief Minister will ensure appropriate measures to address such concerns in the future,  he said in the file note.  Giving his approval to the proposal, the LG said that the Health department of Delhi government was required to refer it to the Ministry of Home Affairs for seeking approval of President of India on it, in accordance with the provisions under Section 45D of Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2023.  The SMHA is mandated to play a pivotal role in registration, supervision, and development of quality care and services along with norms for mental health establishments within the state.

        "articleBody": "Disease outbreaks can be a source of great distress for both patients and authorities alike. However, in a significant development, Bengaluru, the tech capital of India, is taking a proactive step towards predicting these outbreaks well in advance. As per a TOI report, in collaboration with ARTPARK of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the Health and Family Welfare Department are set to unveil a cutting-edge disease surveillance dashboard. This innovative system has the remarkable capability to forecast surges in infections up to four weeks ahead, boasting an impressive accuracy rate of up to 70 per cent.Developed by a team of scientists hailing from IISc, IIT-Madras, and the Indian Statistical Institute, this disease surveillance dashboard marks a significant milestone in post-pandemic disease prediction. Unlike previous mathematical models primarily designed for predicting Covid-19 waves, this dashboard can forecast various communicable diseases, including vector-borne illnesses such as dengue, chikungunya, and malaria. Although initially intended for Bengaluru, it has the potential to make predictions for the entire state.The dashboard team comprises 10-15 experts spanning various fields, including medicine, epidemiology, entomology, and computer science. During a recent review of the dengue situation in Bengaluru, these experts provided a demonstration of the dashboard to Health Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao. Praising this groundbreaking tool, Rao emphasized that it will enable the government and BBMP to take timely measures to contain the spread of any disease.Dr. Bhaskar Rajakumar, the Director of Healthcare at ARTPARK, highlighted the extensive effort put into the development of the related app. He mentioned,  Scientists have dedicated over a year to collect data and resources for the dashboard, while the app is the result of six months of rigorous work.  Leveraging a decade's worth of historical data, this module can forecast disease outbreaks four weeks in advance. Since most vector-borne diseases are sensitive to climate, scientists have gathered data from sources like the India Meteorological Department and the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre.Dr. Rajakumar told TOI,  We initially collected historical dengue data, details from fever clinics, serosurvey statistics, and genomic surveillance data, considering the potential mutation of the virus. Additionally, we analyzed data on people's mobility, changes in vegetation types, land use patterns, and topographical alterations to enhance prediction accuracy.  By extrapolating data from the previous decade to the actual incidence of cases in 2017 and 2018, the scientists achieved a remarkable 70% accuracy rate. They can now predict diseases down to the zonal level in Bengaluru and the sub-district level in the state. To further improve accuracy, the team aims to incorporate data from hospitals and testing labs into the dashboard.",

I have given directions to the officials to work more to control dengue. This month, the cases have risen. We have taken it seriously and now we have given instruction to take measures,  the minister said. Rao said he has asked the BBMP to increase testing for dengue in its six high tech labs. Speaking about the the shortage of Auxiliary Nurses and Midwives (ANM) and main health workers, the minister said that it has been decided to increase their salaries to Rs 18,000 from Rs 12,000 per month.  They (BBMP) say that these ANM and main health workers are not coming forward because of low pay. We have decided to give an additional Rs 6,000 from our department. Now they will start the process of recruiting them,  the minister said. Rao also said the health department will consider Bengaluru as a health unit and treat the municipal area as a separate district instead of considering it as a part of Bengaluru Urban district.",

The event was also attended by health ministers of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Sikkim, Tripura along with senior officials from Meghalaya, Nagaland as well as other states of the region. The Union Minister of State for Ayush and Women & Child Development, Dr. Mahendrabhai Munjapara along with Secretary of Ministry of Ayush, Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha and other senior officials from the ministry, state governments were also present.Sonowal said, \u201cToday we had a very fruitful discussion on the promotion and propagation of Ayush system of medicine in the Northeast region of the country. Along with the rest of the world, the importance and popularity of traditional system of medicine has risen significantly in our beautiful region of Northeast. I must congratulate all our states in the region for taking onus in this regard as is evident from the progress we have achieved in propagating Ayush system of medicine in the region. Under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister, Narendra Modi ji, India has made significant progress in reinventing the age old and proven benefits of traditional system of medicine to enrich the quality of lives of the people. He further said,  Modi ji has not only encouraged the use of traditional medicine in India but has also led a global movement to invest, innovate and integrate traditional medicine with modern medicine to develop a holistic line of healthcare solutions aimed at enriching the quality of lives. In this spirit, I would like to call all the states of northeast India to explore the possibility of setting up an Integrated Ayush Department in all its leading state hospitals, in line with the setting up of similar departments in all 19 AIIMS, under the guidance of Prime Minister. Today, we are presented with this unique opportunity to kick start a movement to set up integrated medicine departments in all our leading state hospitals, thereby popularizing and implementing the concept of Integrated medicine to be emulated by the whole country. We, the people of Northeast region, can realize the vision of Modi ji as the engine of India\u2019s movement towards holistic healthcare, further boost the traditional medicine practices and become hub of an Ayush led economic growth, promoting employment & trade for the region.\u201dDuring the deliberations, the Health Minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Alo Libang said that the state is planning to set up a full fledged Directorate of Ayush Healthcare Services to promote traditional medicine in the Himalayan state. A Special Panchakarma Centre in the middle of Loktak lake was proposed to be set up, as confirmed by the Health Minister of Manipur, Dr Sapam Ranjan Singh. The Mizoram Health Minister, Dr R Lalthangliana also applauded the benefit of traditional medicine and how Ayush gram initiative and Jan Arogya Samiti is popularising the Ayush system of medicine in the state. Sonowal added, \u201cPM Narendra Modi led Government has approved for operationalisation of 12,500 Ayush Health & Wellness Centres (AHWCs) by the Ministry of Ayush through state governments as a component of Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) of National Ayush Mission (NAM) in a phased manner by 2023-24. The main objectives are to establish holistic wellness model based on AYUSH principles and practices, to empower masses for \u201cself care\u201d to reduce the disease burden, out of pocket expenditure and to provide informed choice to the needy public. Ministry of Ayush has released Rs. 449.64 crores to NE States under NAM from 2014-15 to 2022-23. Ministry has also supported 33 Integrated Ayush hospitals in NE states from 2014-15 to 2022-23 and out of that 09 are operational as reported by States. Out of 12,500 AHWCs,Ministry has supported 879AHWCs supported in NE States and out of that 492 are reported functional by the NE States.\u201dSarma said the North-eastern States can immensely contribute towards the further spread of practices such Ayurveda, yoga, naturopathy, unani and homeopathy among the residents of the country. Referring to Ayurveda, yoga, among others, as time-tested practices, Sarma said AYUSH is gradually rising in prominence as focus tilts towards holistic well-being.Sarma also stressed upon the need to capitalize on the opportunities that have been created with the recent mainstreaming of AYUSH practices across the country. He called upon the youths from across the country in general and those from the North-eastern States in particular to make the best use of the entrepreneurial opportunities the AYUSH sector is offering, while adding that at present, as many as 40,000 units of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are involved in production of AYUSH-related items and that the sector can accommodate a much greater number of production units owing to the steady increase in demand such products.Referring to the North-eastern region of the country as a treasure trove of economically-viable plants and herbs with medicinal properties, Sarma said the eight States of the region must strive to attain a status similar to that of Kerala in the field of tourism for traditional medicinal healing and cure. This would contribute towards growth of the tourism and hospitality industry and create a good number of employment opportunities in the region, he added.The Chief Minister expressed concern at the trend of AYUSH doctors and practitioners often prescribing allopathic medicine to their patients. This can be attributed to a lack of pride regarding AYUSH among some of the practitioners of alternative and traditional forms of medicines, Sarma said, adding it has now been proven through various research works that traditional forms of treatments such as Ayurveda, yoga, naturopathy is highly effective and have no side-effects as often seen in the use of allopathic medicines.Sarma exuded confidence the North-eastern States would emerge as one of the hotspots of AYUSH practices in days to come.",

A top official of his country will be visiting India very soon to address the issue of shortage of some crucial drugs including those for cancer in the US, he said.  We have a very strong and dependent relationship with India when it comes to pharmaceuticals. We depend on India, India depends on us and together we can both thrive when it comes to making sure medicines are available not just to our people but to the world,  Becerra told reporters here. He was in Gandhinagar to take part in the G20 Health Ministers' Meeting as well as bilateral meetings with other countries. The US is experiencing disruptions in the supply of some cancer drugs, he said. When asked if he has any plans to meet Indian officials or industry leaders to address the shortage of cancer drugs, Becerra said that is the reason why US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) Commissioner Robert Califf will be visiting India soon.  Because we don't want to see any shortage in supply of any medicines. There have been disruptions in the supply chain for some of the drugs for cancer. India is such an indispensable partner in helping America to have the pharmaceuticals that it needs,  Becerra said. The US is eyeing to increase the domestic capacity for the production of such crucial drugs, but still, it will not be enough, he said.  Strong partners like India make it possible for us to provide our people with the medicines that they need,  he said. Asked about the concerns raised by a US committee about the quality of medicines coming from India, the health secretary clearly said the US wanted the drugs sold in the country to be safe.  We want the drugs sold in our country safe and effective. This applies in India also. I don't see the regulatory regime which the US uses as a challenge (for Indian companies). It is a standard if Indian companies wish to sell products in the US. If India wants to make sure that they have companies which can meet those standards, we are absolutely willing to work with them,  he said. The US standards are transparent, he said, adding that his country wants India to continue to be a  good partner in the exchange of pharmaceuticals .  That requires Indian companies to meet US standards, if they wish to export to us,  Becerra said. He also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that India's role in the healthcare sector has expanded after the COVID-19 pandemic.  We can not let another world crisis, a pandemic, hit us, like Covid did. We know we have to work together. By the way, this is where India's role has increased dramatically. I think Prime Minister Narendra Modi recognizes, people also recognize that India is at a different place than it was a few decades ago. And this is the time when India can show that it is a world leader in this space,  he said. When asked if the US has made up its mind to onboard the digital health platform to be presented by India during the G20 meeting, the secretary said the discussions are still going on because it can prove to be  very dangerous  sans clear standards or road map.  Well, we certainly understand the importance of having digital platforms, especially now with AI really coming into play....At the same time we have to have standards in place so that we don't let those same technologies be used to harm our people. And so, all those are the considerations that people are working on,  he said. Without clear standards or roadmap, such an initiative  could be very dangerous if we don't have the ability to really know how we're going to use this , Becerra added.",

Co-hosted by the government of India, the summit will also explore ways to realise the potential of evidence-based knowledge in the use of traditional medicine for people's health and well-being around the world, the statement issued by the WHO said. WHO director-general and regional directors, G20 health ministers and high-level invitees from countries across the WHO's six regions will participate in the summit. Scientists, practitioners of traditional medicine, health workers and members of civil society organisations will also take part in it. The summit will explore ways to scale up scientific advances and realise the potential of evidence-based knowledge in the use of traditional medicine for people's health and well-being around the world, the statement said. Scientists and other experts will lead technical discussions on research, evidence and learning; policy, data and regulation; innovation and digital health; and biodiversity, equity and indigenous knowledge, it said.  Traditional medicine can play an important and catalytic role in achieving the goal of universal health coverage and meeting global health-related targets that were off-track even before the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,  said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.  Bringing traditional medicine into the mainstream of healthcare -- appropriately, effectively, and above all, safely based on the latest scientific evidence -- can help bridge access gaps for millions of people around the world. It would be an important step toward people-centered and holistic approaches to health and well-being.  Heads of state and government at the 2019 UN high-level meeting on universal health coverage acknowledged the need to include evidence-based traditional and complementary medicine services, particularly in primary health care, a cornerstone of health systems, in pursuit of health for all, the statement said.  Advancing science on traditional medicine should be held to the same rigorous standards as in other fields of health. This may require new thinking on the methodologies to address these more holistic, contextual approaches and provide evidence that is sufficiently conclusive and robust to lead to policy recommendations,  said Dr John Reeder, WHO Director of Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases and Director of Department of Research for Health. The summit will explore research and evaluation of traditional medicine, including methodologies that can be used to develop a global research agenda and priorities in traditional medicine, as well as challenges and opportunities based on 25 years of research in traditional medicine.",

In the wake of two recent sexual crimes against children, which were allegedly carried out by migrant workers, the Kerala government has decided to speed up the registration of the  guest workers  -- as they are addressed by the Left government. On July 28, a five-year-old girl abducted from Aluva in Ernakulam District was brutally raped and killed allegedly by a migrant worker from Bihar. The child's family too hails from the same state. In another incident, on August 4, Malappuram police arrested a 36-year-old man, a migrant labourer from Madhya Pradesh, for allegedly sexually abusing a minor child who also hails from there. State Labour Minister V Sivankutty said officials will ensure that no guest worker is left out from the portal.  The government will also consider setting up help desks at railway stations where guest workers arrive in large numbers,  the minister said in a release. The statewide launch of the portal and registration of guest workers will be held on August 7, the Labour department said. Contractors, who bring guest workers to the state, and employers can register the workers in the portal. It also allows workers to register themselves individually as well. The enrolling officer will examine the details entered in the portal 'athidhi.lc.kerala.gov.in' and issue a unique ID to each worker, the Labour Department said. The portal will collect information regarding the workers and ensure that they have social security, Labour Commissioner Arjun Pandian said. Sivankutty had earlier said that presently migrant workers are regulated according to provisions of the Inter-State Migrant Workers Act of 1979. He had also said that over five lakh migrant workers are registered under the Awas Health Insurance Scheme introduced for them, and the labour department will take steps to identify all unregistered workers and get them onboard as well.",

The chief minister urged people not to panic and to take precaution instead.  Everyone should strictly follow the instructions of the health department and the police and fully cooperate with the restrictions,  he said. Talking to reporters in Kozhikode after receiving confirmation from the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, where the samples were sent for testing, state Health Minister Veena George said one of the people who was infected with the virus is a nine-year-old boy. George said out of the five samples, three have tested positive.  The samples of the person who died yesterday and two others under treatment, including the nine-year-old boy, have tested positive,  she said. The death of the first person, on August 30, was initially considered a death due to the comorbidity of liver cirrhosis, she said.  However, his son, the nine-year-old boy who is already in ICU, and his 24-year-old brother-in-law are the two positive cases that were detected today,  the minister said. The sample of the person who died yesterday also tested positive. The minister added that two epicentres of the disease have been identified, which will soon be declared as containment zones by the district collector after following due procedure. The man who died on August 30 was 44 years old, while the person who died yesterday as a 40-year-old man. The health department has also found out that the deceased persons were together in a private hospital for almost one hour at a particular point of time and as of now, there are no other points of contact for them other than that.

Though the  Ayushman Bhava  campaign will be launched on September 13, it will be introduced during the 'Seva Pakhwada' starting on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday on September 17, he said. Several activities have been planned to enhance healthcare accessibility and awareness during the pakhwada that will end on October 2, Mandaviya stated.  Following the vision of 'Antyodaya', saturation of health services in every village is very important to achieve the target of health for all,  the minister said. Ayushman Bhava is an umbrella campaign comprising Ayushman Apke Dwar 3.0 which is aimed at creation and distribution of Ayushman cards to all remaining eligible beneficiaries; Ayushman Mela as part of which weekly health melas will be held at the level of AB-HWCs and Community Health Centres (CHCs) and Ayushman Sabha, a village/ward level sabha to be held to enhance awareness about various health care schemes and services.  With the successful implementation of all the above initiatives, the campaign will eventually ensure gram/nagar panchayat to attain the status of 'Ayushman Gram Panchayat' or 'Ayushman Ward' with saturation of selected health indicators,  Mandaviya stated. Mandaviya said during this programme, camps will be set up and 60,000 people will be given Ayushman Bharat cards. An online organ donation pledge registry will be initiated during the 'Sewa Pakhwada' to register the pledges of willing citizens all over the country.  A 24x7 toll free helpline number -- 1800114770 -- is functional for providing any guidance related to the pledging process or information on organ donation, according to a letter written by Mandaviya to all cabinet ministers and chief ministers. During the 'Seva Pakhwada', all blood banks will organise at least one blood donation camp to ensure smooth availability of blood and its components in the future. Cleanliness drives at all public health facilities at primary, secondary and tertiary health care levels will be held with the support of gram panchayat members and others. Mandaviya said last year on the prime minister's birthday, the government worked on the issue of tuberculosis.",

        "articleBody": "The Delhi High Court has upheld the Centre's decision to include all medical devices within the ambit of  drug  under the law regulating drugs and cosmetics. A bench headed by Justice Rajiv Shakdher rejected petitions by the Surgical Manufacturers and Traders Association challenging the central government's 2018 and 2020 notifications first declaring four medical devices as  drugs  under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, and then spreading the net to cover all medical devices.  The court said the decision to include all medical devices as  drugs  was a policy matter and no case for interference was made out as there was no arbitrariness or unreasonableness.  MHFW (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare), in its wisdom, thought it fit to bring all medical devices within the ambit of the expression 'drug '. This is clearly a policy matter,  the bench, also comprising Justice Tara Vitasta Ganju, said in a recent order dated September 1.   To our minds, there is no manifest arbitrariness or unreasonableness in the shift in policy of bringing all medical devices within the ambit of a regulatory regime. Our postscript is, if we were to allow the writ petitions, figuratively speaking, we would be throwing away the baby with the bathwater,  the court opined.  The authorities should, however, take measures to quickly iron out the kinks found while progressing the regulatory regime, the court said.  In 2018, the Centre had first brought four medical devices , i.e. nebuliser, blood pressure monitoring device, digital thermometer and glucometer, within the ambit of  drug . In 2020, all medical devices were notified as  drugs .  The court observed that the implementation of the policy was  calibrated  and gave ample time to the manufacturers, importers, sellers and distributors, to transition to a mandatory licensing regime.   MHFW's reasons are manifold, which include the desire to align itself with the international regulatory regime and to further the interest of the patients. Mere errors, if any, in the policy, which is otherwise robust and devised bearing in mind patient safety, cannot be upturned by the court while exercising the power of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution, unless it is a clear case of demonstrable violation of fundamental rights,  the court said.",

The Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare also said that India's G20 Presidency has revolved around the philosophy of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' - the world is one family. She was addressing the G20 Deputies' Meeting that commenced here on Thursday ahead of the G20 Health Ministers' Meeting starting Friday.  India's G20 Presidency has revolved around the philosophy of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' - the world is one family. Nowhere is this more important than in the field of global health as the pandemic taught us that no one is safe until everyone is safe,  an official release quoted her saying in her inaugural address. Dr V K Paul, Member (Health) of NITI Aayog, was also present at the meeting that is underway at the Mahatma Mandir convention centre in Gandhinagar as part of India's G20 presidency. Union minister Pawar underlined the crucial deliberations that have been taking place in the Health Working Groups of India's G20 Presidency. Noting that the first priority addressing Health Emergencies Prevention Preparedness and Response (HEPPR) has been a core priority in every G20 Health Working Group since inception, she said,  The Indian G20 Presidency has put special focus on the critical threats of One Health, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and climate change.   The second priority on addressing the need to ensure equitable access to affordable medical countermeasures highlights the need to establish a global MCM (medical countermeasures) coordination platform that envisions the establishment of research and development, and manufacturing networks across the globe,  she said. This will enable access to quality and affordable vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, the minister noted. On the development and use of digital health innovations and solutions which is the third health priority under India's G20 Presidency, Pawar said the Global Initiative for Digital Health (GIDH) has been envisaged to have a convergent approach that breaks the silos and ensures that existing and ongoing digital health efforts can be made accessible under one umbrella.  The crucial task of ensuring all the hard work and incredible efforts during the Indian G20 presidency comes to fulfilment today. The declaration that you will be finalising today will be the culmination of deep and informed discussion that has taken place over three working group meetings and countless bilateral and multilateral meetings,  she added. Pawar said that addressing inequality in access to healthcare is at the core of all our efforts under this G20 presidency.  The three priorities and their related deliverables have the potential to make global healthcare services more accessible and affordable, especially for people in vulnerable situations and those in low-and middle-income countries,  she added. Union Health Secretary Sudhansh Pant said the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in rapid development of ad hoc global mechanisms to address the imperative need to prevent the pandemic from worsening and to plan for future pandemics.  This, however, led to considerable duplication of efforts and fragmentation. Therefore, India's G20 Presidency since the beginning emphasized the need for convergence of efforts in the HEPPR space as a major priority to aid in creating a converged and agile global health architecture,  he said. Pant added that India's G20 Health Working Groups and the 14 co-branded events arranged alongside covered the pressing health concerns in the world. He also noted that the discussions in the last three Health Working Groups got us closer to our mutual goal of building a convergent global health architecture. The statement said that members of the Troika from Indonesia and Brazil commended the Indian Presidency for prioritising the key health challenges in the world today. They recommended collaboration on adopting a multi-sectoral approach and investing in better health systems.",

We believe that this initiative will not only benefit the nurses by offering them enriching career prospects in foreign countries but also contribute to enhancing the global reputation of the nursing community from Meghalaya. I am proud to share that we have more than 11,000 registered members in the Meghalaya nursing council. India is poised to supply over 40% of skilled labour for the next two to three decades, and we recognize the immense potential in our educated nurses within and outside the State.

He further added,  A substantial portion of this income can be sent back to families in Meghalaya, amounting to about Rs. 80,000 to 1 lakh. Even a short stay of 3-4 years abroad can lead to savings of around 20-25 lakh rupees.

The Centre informed the Supreme Court that only four states have submitted their responses.The SC warned that it will  take recourse to the coercive arm of the law  if they failed to do so by August 31.A bench of justices Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and also comprising justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra issued the direction after Delhi, Haryana, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh submitted their responses.Aishwarya Bhati, Additional Solicitor General, stated that pursuant to the April 10 order this year, responses have been received by the Union Government only from governments of Delhi, Haryana, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. We direct all other states and union territories to submit their responses positively by 31 August 2023,  the court said.The States and Union Territories, which are in default, are placed on notice that should there be any further default in submitting their responses, the Court would be constrained to take recourse to the coercive arm of the law, the court said and listed the proceedings on 6 November 2023 for further hearing.The Supreme Court had earlier asked all State Governments to send their menstrual hygiene policies to the Centre within a period of four weeks.The apex court had also asked the Centre to engage all States to see that a uniform national policy is implemented relating to sanitary pads for school-going girls.It remarked that the petitioner raises an important issue of public interest bearing on the need for menstrual hygiene of girls who are studying in schools.Centre, represented by Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, had urged the court that all States and UTs may be directed to submit their menstrual hygiene management strategies and plans which are being executed either with the help of funds provided by the central government or their own funds, to the Mission Steering Group (MSG) of the National Health Mission (NHM) within a period of 4-6 weeks. The mission steering group can re-evaluate the national guidelines based on experiential learning of the last ten-plus years.Centre response had come on a plea seeking to issue directions to governments to provide free sanitary pads to girls studying in Classes 6 to 12.Centre had also apprised the court about its proposal to direct all states and UTs to make provisions for ensuring the availability of quality low-cost sanitary pads, and vending machines in schools. All States and UTs may further be directed to ensure that a disposal mechanism is available for schools/school complexes having girls' enrollment in upper-primary/Secondary/ Higher Secondary classes for safe disposal of sanitary pads.Taking note of the importance of the matter, the court had issued various directions including one that all states should send the Union their menstrual hygiene policies within a period of 4 weeks and to ensure low-cost sanitary napkins and safe disposal mechanisms. The court nominated the secretary of the health ministry to facilitate the process.The court was hearing a plea seeking to issue directions to governments to provide free sanitary pads to girls studying in classes 6 to 12.The plea has been moved by social activist Jaya Thakur through advocates Varinder Kumar Sharma and Varun Thakur.The petitioner said that serious difficulty is faced by adolescent females between the ages of 11 and 18 years coming from poor backgrounds. These are adolescent females who are not equipped with and are also not educated by their parents about menstruation and menstrual hygiene. The deprived economic status and illiteracy leads to the prevalence of unhygienic and unhealthy practices which has serious health consequences; increases obstinacy and leads to eventual dropping out from schools,  the petitioner said.Henceforth, in the plea, the petitioner has sought to issue directions to provide the separate girl toilet in all Government, Aided and residential schools and to issue directions to provide one cleaner in all Government, Aided and residential schools to clean the toilets.The plea also sought to issue a writ order or directions in the nature of mandamus to the Respondents to provide a three-stage awareness programme i.e. Firstly, the spreading of awareness about menstrual health and unboxing the taboos that surround it; Secondly, providing adequate sanitation facilities and subsidised or free sanitary products to women and young students, especially in disadvantaged areas; thirdly, to ensure an efficient and sanitary manner of menstrual waste disposal.In India, the right to health derives from the Directive Principles of State Policy and is an established right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India which guarantees the right to life and dignity, the petition said.The ability to manage menstruation in a hygienic manner is fundamental to the dignity and well-being of women, especially in a democratic society. It constitutes an integral component of basic hygiene, sanitation, and reproductive health services. Inadequate menstrual hygiene management compromises girls' education, health, and well-being.Therefore, efforts to address these inadequacies must involve the provision of sanitation and hygiene facilities along with creating an enabling social and physical environment that addresses all menstruation-related needs, the petition said.

Kant was addressing the maiden Global Food Regulators Summit 2023 here.  This is the first time a meeting of this nature is being held during India's G20 presidency. We feel strongly that locally adapted crops are significant for the transition towards resilient agriculture and food systems,  he said. To strengthen research, collaboration and public awareness of green crops, the G20 in its agriculture ministerial meeting, launched millet and other ancient grains international research initiative called Maharishi. The former bureaucrat said the world is passing through a critical time as one-third of the world is in recession, and 75 countries of the world are facing a global debt crisis. Also, there is a major crisis of food, fuel and fertiliser in several countries.  The need of the hour is not only to focus on the immediate crisis and short-term measures but also for all countries to make their food systems more resilient in the long run,  he said and urged the global food regulators to consider encouraging the cultivation of alternative crops beyond the major grains. He also talked about India's initiatives to popularise the use of millet. He informed that not a single meal is served at programs being held during India's presidency. This, he said, is being done to promote alternative crops. He further said:  It is important to mobilise private funding towards research and development in climate resilient and sustainable agriculture...it's important to ensure the protection of the most vulnerable groups through targeted social protection programmes such as food subsidies . Kant also emphasised the increasing cooperation among government, private businesses and international partners, so that nutritious production systems, which ensure proper food security, are taken care of.  It's also important to implement food waste prevention programmes to reduce food insecurity. There is just too much food wastage in the world,  he said. India's G20 Sherpa stressed on the deployment of digital tools to enhance agricultural practices, such as using soil maps to increase the efficient use of fertiliser. He urged the gathering to utilise the summit platform for learning, strengthening networks to improve food safety and creating a mechanism for investing in food safety in a sustainable way. This summit is an endeavour of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) under the aegis of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) to create a global platform of food regulators to exchange perspectives on strengthening food safety systems and regulatory framework across the food value chain.",

The PCPNDT law was enacted with the intent to prohibit the use of prenatal diagnostic techniques for determination of the sex of the foetus. A bench of Justices AS Bopanna and MM Sundresh issued notices to all the states and sought their replies within six weeks. Senior advocate Pinki Anand, appearing for petitioner advocate Shobha Gupta, said the law is not being implemented in  letter and spirit  and, as mandated under the Act, authorities need to be appointed in states which is not being done.  This court has only issued notice to the Centre but no notices were issued to the state. The states need to apprise the court why appropriate authorities have not been appointed,  she said. Anand said the corresponding rules framed under the Act mandate that appeal must be filed against any order of acquittal under the law whose object is to save unborn children.  The figures we have obtained indicate that no appeals are filed after the acquittal and necessary action is not being taken by the authorities concerned,  she submitted, while pointing to non-appointment of the authorities under the Act by the states and Union Territories.  On September 5 last year, the top court had issued notice on the plea which sought directions to the appropriate authorities at all levels to ensure strict compliance with the Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Rules, 1966 with further directions that any failure shall attract adverse consequences. Gupta also sought directions to the appropriate authority for initiation of punishment under section 25 of the PNDT Act against an offender. The top court said considering the facts highlighted in the writ petition it was seeking reply from the union ministry of health and family welfare.  It said the union government's response shall indicate the steps undertaken by central agencies for enforcement of the provisions of the law. The plea has alleged various provisions of the PCPNDT Act are not being enforced effectively and offenders are not booked for deliberate violation of the rules. The petition said statistics from various states show the rate of conviction under the Act is quite low.",

The body was taken though the Khwairamband Ima Market where hundreds paid a floral tribute to him. Women were not allowing the police to take away the body.The state police along with the Rapid Action Force fired several rounds of stun bombs and teargas shells and got the body, and deposited it at the hospital morgue. Later, irate mob set ablaze a police outpost set up at the Khwairamband Ima Market. More than 100 people have lost their lives in the ethnic violence between Meitei and Kuki communities in the northeastern state so far.",

        "articleBody": "The government is set to crackdown on fixed-dose combination (FDC) drugs containing vitamins and minerals, some of which, experts warn, are irrational and unsafe, people in the know said.A committee had been set up under the chairmanship of CK Kokate, former vice-chancellor of KLE University, Belgaum, to review the safety, efficacy and therapeutic justification of these drugs. The Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB), India's top technical board on drugs, has now asked the panel for a report on their evaluation. The report will now go to the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). The health ministry will take a final decision following the recommendation of the DTAB,  one of the people cited earlier said.Another source said,  The committee has reviewed whether they are rational, appropriate. Different mixtures of vitamins and minerals are available in the market. People pop them in as a daily requirement and it needs to be checked if they are posing a risk. The crackdown on FDCs in the country has been continuing since 2016. Earlier this month, the government banned 14 FDC drugs, citing that there was  no therapeutic justification  for these medicines.The Kokate committee had declared many FDCs irrational, which were needed to be prohibited under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, as other safer alternatives to those combinations are available.A FDC drug contains two or more active ingredients in a fixed dosage ratio. The drugs are deemed rational when claims for their benefits are supported by evidence-based data and well-designed clinical studies.In 2016, the Centre had banned 344 FDCs pursuant to the report submitted in January 2015, in which the committee led by Kokate, then vice-chancellor of KLE University, had deemed the FDCs  irrational .The committee had said that these FDCs posed health risks and hence should be banned, pushing some of the companies and pharma groups to challenge the government's notification banning FDCs in court.In December 2017, the Supreme Court referred the matter to DTAB for a fresh review on whether these drugs should continue to be marketed. The top court suggested that DTAB should decide whether the manufacture and sale of these drugs should be regulated, restricted or banned outright, and asked the committee to submit its report and recommendations to the government within six months.An expert panel was then formed under the chairmanship of Nilima Kshirsagar to review the safety and efficacy of these drugs. The panel, after considering these drugs  irrational , citing safety issues and lack of therapeutic justification, recommended continuing the ban. The panel also found that many FDCs were formulated without due diligence, with dosing mismatches that could result in toxicity.A parliamentary standing committee of the ministry of health and family welfare, in its 59th report in 2012, also observed that some of the state licensing authorities issued manufacturing licences for a large number of FDCs without prior clearance from the central drug authority, resulting in the availability of several FDCs which were not tested for safety and efficacy.",

        "articleBody": "In a significant and people-centric move, cashless treatment facilities will now be available to CGHS beneficiaries, both serving and pensioners, at AIIMS-New Delhi, PGIMER-Chandigarh and JIPMER-Puducherry. A memorandum of agreement (MoA) to this effect was signed between the three institutions -- All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, Post-Graduate Institute of Medical education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh and Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry -- and the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in the presence of Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan here on Tuesday. The initiative builds upon six MoAs signed on May 20 between the CGHS and the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences located in Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Patna, Jodhpur, Raipur and Rishikesh.  The extension of patient-care facilities at AIIMS-New Delhi, PGIMER-Chandigarh and JIPMER-Puducherry to the CGHS beneficiaries on a cashless basis will be particularly beneficial for the pensioner beneficiaries of the CGHS. It eliminates the need for them to submit individual reimbursement claims and follow up for approvals,  Bhushan said. With this new initiative, the CGHS beneficiaries will have direct access to state-of-the-art treatment facilities at these medical institutions, without the hassle of making upfront payments and seeking reimbursements from the CGHS. The streamlined process will save time, reduce paperwork and expedite the settlement of individual claims, Bhushan said.  Previously, the CGHS pensioner beneficiaries availing treatment at these institutions were required to make payments upfront and claim reimbursement later from the CGHS,  the health secretary said at the signing of the MoA. He appreciated the development and highlighted that the CGHS is a significant service-oriented vertical of the health ministry through which existing and retired employees can avail medical services.  The government aims to expand the number of hospitals empanelled under the CGHS to provide excellent tertiary-care facilities aligned with the rising requirements of the patients,  Bhushan said. He further emphasised that this agreement will benefit a large segment of the population by simplifying lengthy formalities and expediting access to medical care. He also noted that the agreement will help expand the reach of the CGHS services across the country, allowing the beneficiaries to avail the CGHS facilities at the institutes of national importance (INIs) in their respective states. Additionally, the CGHS has revised certain rates of treatment and medical care, further facilitating access to treatment facilities for patients, Bhushan said. According to the salient features of this initiative, cashless treatment will be available in outpatient departments (OPDs), investigations and indoor treatment for the CGHS pensioners and other eligible categories of beneficiaries. The three institutions will raise credit bills for the CGHS pensioners and other eligible beneficiaries, and the CGHS will preferably make the payment within 30 days of receiving the bills. The CGHS beneficiaries will be admitted only upon the production of a valid CGHS beneficiary identity card for treatment at these institutions. Separate help desks and accounting systems will be created for the CGHS beneficiaries at AIIMS-New Delhi, PGIMER-Chandigarh and JIPMER-Puducherry. The medicines prescribed by the doctors at these institutions, whether for OPD treatment or at the time of discharge, will be collected by the beneficiaries through the CGHS. The CGHS beneficiaries will no longer require referrals to access healthcare facilities at these institutions.",

        "articleBody": "A team of experts from the Union health ministry, ICMR, IMD and NDMA will visit Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to support the two states in public health response measures to address heat-related illnesses. This was directed by Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday as he chaired a high-level meeting related to public health preparedness for heatwave management across the country. Union Minister of State for Health Bharati Pravin Pawar and Dr V K Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog, were also present at the meeting. Several states have been experiencing severe heatwave conditions for the last few days. Underscoring the importance of sturdy and timely preparedness through awareness and early actions, Mandaviya also directed the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to conduct research on how to minimise the effects of heatwave on health, with specific short, medium and long-term action plans. The health minister said the Centre has taken timely measures ahead of the summer season to address heatwave-related illnesses. Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting to review preparedness ahead of the summer season in March, while the health ministry issued a heatwave advisory in February, advising the states to review health facility preparedness in terms of essential medicines, intravenous fluids, packs, ORS, drinking water as well as dissemination of necessary IEC materials. The National Action Plan on Heat Related Illnesses was also shared with all the states. At the meeting, Mandaviya was briefed on the status of heatwaves in various states and the preparedness of central agencies in terms of availability of required supplies and hospital infrastructure to provide timely and effective healthcare services. It was also apprised that daily surveillance on heat-related illnesses under the National Programme on Climate Change and Human Health (NPCCHH) has been ensured in all states and districts through the Integrated Health Information Platform (IHIP) and all the health facilities have been asked to participate using the P-form level login. The National Action Plan on Heat Related Illnesses, prepared by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), was released in July 2021. It outlines the standard operating procedures (SOP) for surveillance of heatstroke cases and deaths with a preparedness plan before and during the summer season. It also provides a special emphasis on Heat Related Illnesses (HRI) in elderly, infants and children, pregnant women, outdoor and manual workers, and other vulnerable sections. Under this action plan, states are advised to increase resiliency to extreme heat at the level of health facilities by ensuring uninterrupted electric supply, installation of solar panels and measures to reduce indoor heat through a cool or green roof, window shading, outside shades etc.  Sensitisation of masses is important, but sensitisation and capacity building of medical officers, health staff and grass-root level workers on heat-related illnesses, their early recognition and management is also important,  Mandaviya said. He urged the states and central agencies to enhance awareness among people regarding the preventive measures through multi-media IEC campaigns. Mandaviya asked the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to issue daily weather forecasts in a manner that can be easily interpreted and disseminated.",

        "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: The prevalence of diabetes in India is 11.4 per cent, while 35.5 per cent and 15.3 per cent of people suffer from hypertension and prediabetes respectively, according to the findings of a nationwide survey published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal. The largest epidemiological study on diabetes and non-communicable diseases (NCD) estimates that in 2021, there were 101 million people with diabetes in India, 136 million with prediabetes, and 315 million had high blood pressure.  The study, conducted by the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF) in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and funded by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, also found that the prevalence of generalised obesity and abdominal obesity in India stood at 28.6 and 39.5 per cent, respectively.  The estimate shows that 254 million people in India had generalised obesity, and 351 million had abdominal obesity in 2021.  In 2017, the team found that the prevalence of diabetes in India was around 7.5 per cent, meaning there has been an increase of over 50 per cent in the burden since then.  Among the states, Goa (26.4 per cent) had the highest prevalence of diabetes and Uttar Pradesh (4.8 per cent) had the lowest, while Sikkim (31.3 per cent) and Mizoram (6.8 per cent) had the highest and lowest burden of prediabetes.  Punjab (51.8 per cent) had the highest prevalence of hypertension while Meghalaya (24.3 per cent) had the highest burden, the researchers said.   The steep increase in NCDs can be attributed mostly to the lifestyle choices of people such as diet, physical activity, stress levels etc. The positive news is that interventions can be used to curb the trend. Our study has multiple implications for the planning and provision of health care in India,  Dr. R. M. Anjana, President, MDRF, told PTI.   The diabetes epidemic in India is in transition, with some states having already reached their peak rates while others are just getting started. These states may see an increase in prevalence over the next 3-5 years before plateauing,  Anjana, lead author of the study, said.  The results, assessing the burden of NCDs across the states, are based on a survey of 1,13,043 (over 1.1akh) people (33,537 urban and 79,506 rural residents), in 31 states and Union Territories in the country, between 2008 and 2020.  The survey also showed that an alarming 81.2 per cent have dyslipidaemia, the imbalance of lipids such as cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, (LDL-C), triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).  All metabolic NCDs except prediabetes were more frequent in urban than rural areas. In many states with a lower human development index, the ratio of diabetes to prediabetes was less than 1.   Our study results have multiple implications for the planning and provision of health care in India,  said V. Mohan, Chairman, Dr. Mohan's Diabetes Specialities Centre (DMDSC) and MDRF.   State governments in India, who are primarily in charge of providing healthcare in their respective regions, will be especially interested in the detailed state-level data on these NCDs as it will allow them to develop evidence-based interventions to successfully halt the progression of NCDs and manage their complications,  Mohan, senior author of the study, said in a statement.  The team, including researchers from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, conducted the survey in multiple phases with a stratified multistage sampling design, using three-level stratification based on geography, population size, and socioeconomic status of each state.   The prevalence of diabetes and other metabolic NCDs in India is considerably higher than previously estimated. While the diabetes epidemic is stabilising in the more developed states of the country, it is still increasing in most other states,  the authors of the study said.   Thus, there are serious implications for the nation, warranting urgent state-specific policies and interventions to arrest the rapidly rising epidemic of metabolic NCDs in India,  they said.",

Senior advocate Devajit Saikia, her counsel, told PTI that the case has been filed at the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division) of Kamrup Metropolitan on Friday and it will be moved on September 26.  My client has claimed a defamation of Rs 10 crore against Gaurav Gogoi for various tweets on X. We have made it very clear that we never made any application to receive subsidy,  he added. Saikia further claimed that the process to seek subsidy has not been initiated at all and for which, a show cause notice was slapped on his client's firm on May 26 this year, followed by an email from the Ministry of Food Processing.  The approval for the project was given on November 22, 2022. In the last email, we were told that our claim would lapse if we didn't submit our proposal. We are not responding to anything to seek subsidy,  he added. Whatever Gogoi stated on social media about Sarma and her entity 'Pride East Entertainments', that information was not based on facts, claimed the senior advocate.  He (Gogoi) did not do his homework. Getting approval for a project does not mean that a subsidy has been received. We will fight the case tooth and nail,  he asserted. A huge controversy erupted after Guwahati-based digital media 'The Crosscurrent' published a report alleging that over 50 bigha (nearly 17 acres) of agricultural land at Darigaji village in Kaliabor in Nagaon district was reclassified as industrial land within a month after it was bought by Pride East Entertainments, in which the chief minister's wife is the chairman and managing director. Following this, Gogoi, in a series of tweets for several days, brought allegations of corruption against Sarma and his wife in getting central government subsidy for the project. The Deputy Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha sought the intervention of Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal in bringing facts out in the open regarding subsidy for the project under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) and Scheme for Creation of Infrastructure for Agro Clusters. The Assam MP also pointed out that on March 22, 2023, Goyal in a reply to questions in Lok Sabha on the government's initiative to invest in Assam in order to support the promotion of industries, provided a list of food processing projects supported under the component of PMKSY as on January 31, 2022.  At Serial No 7 of the list, the name of M/S Pride East Entertainment Pvt Ltd has been mentioned. Pertinently, the amount of approved Grant-in-Aid is mentioned as Rs 10 crore. The list of beneficiaries can also be found on the website of the Ministry of Food Processing Industries,  he added. The PM Kisan Sampada Yojana is a comprehensive package which aims to create modern infrastructure with efficient supply chain management from farm gate to retail outlet. Gogoi's claims were vehemently challenged by the chief minister, who was engaged in a prolonged duel with the Congress leader on X. His wife had threatened to sue the MP alleging defamation.",

The government on August 9 announced it would sell an additional 50 lakh tonne of wheat and 25 lakh tonne of rice under the OMSS to bulk users. Wheat is being sold through weekly e-auction at a reserve price of Rs 2,125 per quintal, which is at par with the current minimum support price.  The successful implementation of the OMSS policy has ensured that the prices of wheat are kept under control in the open market, and sufficient stock of wheat is available in the central pool for the continuation of OMSS policy for the remaining period of 2023-24,  the food ministry said in a statement. Till September 21, a total of 13 e-auctions have been conducted, wherein 18.09 lakh tonne of wheat has been sold under the scheme, it said. A quantity of 2 lakh tonne of wheat is being offered in each weekly auction across the country from more than 480 depots during the year 2023-24, it said. The ministry said the weighted average selling price of wheat in the e-auction was Rs 2,254.71 per quintal in August, which has come down to Rs 2,163.47 per quintal on September 20.  The downward trend in the weighted average selling price of wheat suggests that the market prices of wheat have cooled down in the open market,  the statement said. In each weekly e-auction conducted, the quantity sold has not crossed 90 per cent of the quantity offered, which shows that sufficient stocks of wheat are being offered across the country, it added.",

Nonetheless, the average inflation during April-August 2023, was 5.6 per cent, which is within the RBI tolerance limit of 2-6 per cent.   103856876Meanwhile, the economy's outlook report highlighted that the monsoon deficit in August could impact both Kharif and Rabi crops which requires assessment. However, it is a relief that the monsoon deficit of August has been partially plugged in September, the report added. Despite a 10 per cent deficient monsoon this year, vis-a-vis June-September, The kharif sowing (excluding cotton) is 0.8 per cent higher than the corresponding period last year, as of September 15. As per the economic review, normal or excess rains were received in around 83 per cent of the country\u2019s area. While the sown area under pulses and oil seeds remains lower than year ago period, the sowing of kharif rice has emerged as major contributor to the growth with 2.7 per cent higher than 2022.   103856936The DEA's outlook did mention an emerging concern which is the recent run-up in oil prices.  But, no alarms yet,  it said. Oil prices hovered near 10-month highs this week, as a bigger-than-expected draw in US oil stockpiles along with weak US shale output reinforcing fears of tight crude supply for the rest of 2023.Global benchmark Brent crude futures climbed 6 cents, or 0.1%, to $94.40 a barrel on September 20, staying near the highest since November of $95.96 hit on the previous day.Earlier this week, industry data showed U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell last week by about 5.25 million barrels, Reuters reported. As per a Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. rejoined the $100-a-barrel oil club, raising its forecast for crude back to triple digits as worldwide demand hits unprecedented levels and OPEC+ supply curbs continue to tighten the market.The DEA's outlook remains bright for FY24 amid continued momentum in economic activity.  In sum, we remain comfortable with our 6.5 per cent real GDP growth estimate for FY24 with symmetric risks,  it said. ",

The exercise will continue till October, and the regulator is expected to submit its report to the health ministry by December, FSSAI Advisor (Quality Assurance) Satyen K Panda said. The surveillance survey will cover 766 districts across the country and over 10,000 samples will be collected during the exercise. Two agencies have been engaged for the purpose,  he told PTI.Quality Council of India, an autonomous body under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the National Dairy Development Board will conduct the survey for FSSAI, Panda said. The scope for the survey includes milk, khoa, chenna, paneer, ghee, butter, curd, and ice cream. The test parameters are adulterants, normal quality and compositional parameters, contaminants, antibiotic residues and microbiological indicators,  he said.The study was initiated to assess milk and milk products sold in the country for compliance with Food Safety and Standards Regulations, and also to identify hotspots for adulteration.One of the objectives of the survey is to devise corrective action strategies, Panda said.The rationale behind choosing milk is its indispensable role in food culture either as a fresh fluid or as a processed dairy product, he said. We are hopeful of submitting a report on the findings of the survey to the health ministry by December,  Panda said.The regulator has conducted five surveys on milk and milk items since 2011.FSSAI had, in 2022, conducted a milk survey in 12 states, including 10 where the Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) was prevalent.It also undertook the PAN India Milk Products Survey, 2020 to understand the true picture of the safety and quality of milk products being sold in the market during festivals.In all, 2,801 milk product samples from organised and unorganised sectors were collected from 542 districts across the country for the 2020 study.These products were tested for all the quality and safety parameters, including pesticide residues, heavy metals, crop contaminants and melamine.",

It could restart after duty (on parboiled rice) becomes nil post Oct. 15,  said Himanshu Agarwal, executive director at exporter Satyam Balajee. Global prices spiked after India imposed a 20% duty on parboiled exports on Aug. 25 in addition to existing curbs on non-basmati white rice.  We're just giving indicative prices to buyers. Nobody is making purchases at these levels,  said an exporter. Thailand's 5% broken rice prices eased to $613-$615 per metric ton from $620 last week. Prices slipped due to a weaker baht but were still high, a trader said, adding farmers were considering increasing production. Deliveries were only being made on previously agreed prices to Iraq, Philippines and Malaysia, the trader added. Vietnam's 5% broken rice prices retreated to $620-$630 from $630-$640 last week. Buyers from the Philippines remained quiet, a Ho Chi Minh City-based trader said. But another trader in the Mekong Delta said tight supplies and rising demand from Africa and Indonesia should cap declines. Shipments during January-August stood at 5.8 million tons, leaving only 1-2 million tons for exports until year-end, he added. Data showed 172,750 tons for loading at Ho Chi Minh City port during Sept. 1-16, bound mostly for Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Bangladesh has enough stocks -- about 1.7 million tonnes at present-- offering relief amid elevated global prices, although domestic rates were still high, a senior Food Ministry official said.

In July, the consumer price index based retail inflation spiked to 15-month high of 7.44 per cent in July, with specific food commodities mainly driving the increase.  Speaking at the 'Monthly Asia-Pacific Credit Focus' webinar, Rana said in India the monsoon has been very patchy and overall rain was about 11 per cent below normal.   That is a significant concern as it can affect grain prices in India over next few months,  he said.  The government has already imposed export curbs on rice and levied a 40 per cent export duty on onions to make available enough stock in local market ahead of the festive season.   Supplies remain very strong and the government is likely to step in to prevent significant increase in commodity, wheat and rice prices. It will help to keep food price inflation little bit low,  Rana said.  Tomato prices, which had skyrocketed in July, had started cooling in late August.  The significant spike in vegetable prices is coming down, Rana said.   Overall, the inflation environment for India will depend on energy prices. Food prices will remain elevated but is unlikely to go up because of public policies. We expect overall inflation to remain elevated but not rising further for India over the next few months,  Rana added.  The finance ministry in its monthly report had last month said that price pressure on food items is expected to be transitory, but the government and RBI need to step up vigil to deal with elevated inflationary pressure.  Going forward, while domestic consumption and investment demand are expected to continue driving growth, global and regional uncertainties and domestic disruptions may keep inflationary pressures elevated for the coming months, warranting greater vigilance by the government and the RBI, it had said.",

India, the world\u2019s top rice shipper, has now restricted exports of every variety of the staple. It is also selling tomatoes, onions and grains from state reserves to improve local supplies.But Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra said in an interview on Friday that thanks to ample grain reserves, plus an imminent new rice crop, the country\u2019s situation was not worrisome. Normal to above-normal rains are also forecast in many areas this month, offsetting the impact of disruptions including the driest August in more than a century.\u201cThe government has taken many steps to ensure the food security of the country,\u201d Chopra said. \u201cAs of now, there are no proposals for any further export curbs,\u201d he said, adding restrictions had already served their purpose.Government stockpiles of rice and wheat are sufficient to run food and other welfare programs, while procurement of rice from the 2023-24 harvest will begin in October, boosting state reserves further. The government will, though, monitor stockpiles of pulses and other foods held by traders to stop hoarding.Wheat Duties Local wheat supplies are also adequate to meet demand in the world\u2019s second-biggest producer and consumer, Chopra said, adding that the government hadn\u2019t taken any decision yet on whether to scrap import duties, a move that would make purchases from overseas more attractive.\u201cAll options are open,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are monitoring the situation.

This time in all likelihood prices would be in line with last year, hardly any increase,  said Manoj Verma, chief operating officer at Bikaji Foods International. Even though food inflation is high in general, some key ingredients that are used for making traditional Indian sweets are cheaper from a year earlier, which will help in containing the prices, he said. While the prices of dry fruits have gone up 10-12% over last year, palm oil, which is extensively used for deep frying during the festivity, costs less than last year, adding to the advantage of the sweet makers and consumers. The price of another key ingredient - milk - has remained stable in the wholesale market, making other important dairy items such as mawa, chena and ghee also affordable.103221560The price of sugar is also only marginally up. The wholesale price of sugar was up 3.63% as on August 29 compared with a year earlier, according to data from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs.Mithai makers plan to absorb any marginal increase in the cost of their offerings, giving consumers a breather during the most popular festival season, which has started with Onam and Rakshabandhan in August and will continues till Christmas in December.

        "articleBody": "Indian officials are proposing to extend a free grains program well into next year\u2019s national election season, according to people familiar with the matter, a move likely to support Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s reelection bid for a third term.The proposal involves continuing a $24 billion program by another six months to June 2024, said the people who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. A final decision will be taken by Modi\u2019s office in the coming months, they added. The extra cost is expected to be nominal and can be met through this year\u2019s budget allocation, the people said. The initiative was launched in December last year to provide free grains to about 800 million people until end-2023. Extending the program until June next year coincides with the national vote that must be held by summer. Modi has polled above 60% in opinion surveys and is likely to lead his party to victory though there\u2019s some voter discontent over rising unemployment and higher living costs. A spokesperson from the Finance Ministry did not respond to a request for a comment. The free grains program has in part helped Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party to stay ahead of the opposition in the South Asian country, which accounts for nearly 30% of the world\u2019s low-income population. The party and its allies won elections in seven out of the ten state polls so far this year and there are five more due before the year ends.Prolonging the program could help rein in inflation, which jumped to a 15-month high last month. Uneven monsoon rains and drier weather conditions could affect crop production, prompting the government to ban some exports of rice varieties and restrict stockpiling of food commodities. ",

Increased minimum support prices and prospects of healthy kharif crops will further add strength to the rural demand going forward, it added.Driven by a spike in price pressure in food, retail inflation hit a 15-month peak of 7.44% in July but core inflation stayed at a 39-month low.\u201cRussia\u2019s decision to terminate the Black Sea Grain deal, along with dry conditions in major wheat-growing areas, caused the price spike in cereals.

        "articleBody": "The government will implement fully rice fortification programme before the scheduled target of March 2024, a top food ministry official said on Tuesday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day address in 2021, said the government aims to distribute fortified rice via the government schemes by 2024.  Thereafter, a scheme for the distribution of fortified rice, containing prescribed micronutrients (Iron, Folic Acid, Vitamin B12) was launched in October 2021 in a phased manner in order to address the problem of anaemia in children and women.  In April 2022, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the supply of fortified rice throughout the Public Distribution System (PDS), Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman-PM POSHAN (erstwhile Mid-Day Meal Scheme) and other welfare schemes in all states and Union Territories (UTs) by 2024 in a phased manner.  The entire cost of rice fortification, which is around Rs 2,700 crore per annum, would be borne by the Centre as part of the food subsidy till its full implementation up to June 2024.   We had planned to complete the universalisation of fortified PDS rice by March 2024. But, with the pace of distribution, we are hopeful of reaching the target before that and the entire PDS (rice) will be fortified ...in the next few months,  Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra told reporters here.  As of date, he said the Food Corporation of India (FCI) has 240 lakh tonnes of rice, of which just 12 lakh tonnes is non-fortified rice.  Chopra also asserted that fortified rice is safe for people with sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia.  He explained that through PDS fortified rice only 7 mg per day of iron will be consumed while the human body can take 40-45 mg per day of iron.  The secretary said the government will also look at revising the advisory on fortified rice being harmful to people with sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia in light of new evidence.  Globally, Chopra said, 90 countries are using fortification of food items.  The Department of Food and Public Distribution organised a one-day National Seminar on Rice Fortification here.  While addressing the seminar, Chopra said,  We are on track to achieve the target of 100 per cent distribution of fortified rice across all rice-consuming districts in the country.   As per the plan, in the first phase, the target was to cover ICDS and PM POSHAN in India by March 2022.  Under the second phase, the plan was to extend the scheme to beneficiaries of PDS and other welfare schemes in all aspirational and high-burden districts on stunting (a total of 291 districts) by March 2023.  In the third phase, the target was to cover the remaining districts of the country by March 2024.  In April this year, Chopra informed that a total of 269 districts in 27 states started distributing fortified rice under PDS, achieving a 100 per cent target set for Phase II by March 2023.  The ministry has also developed Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) for adherence to Quality Assurance (QA) & Quality Control (QC) protocols on the production and distribution of fortified rice/ FRKs (fortified rice kernels).  Food regulator FSSAI, the regulatory/licensing authority for food fortification, has drafted standards for FRK and Pre-mix, and provided direction to all the stakeholders for the operationalisation of draft standards with immediate effect.",

        "articleBody": "India is in talks with Russia to import wheat at a discount to surging global prices in a rare move to boost supplies and curb food inflation ahead of state and national elections next year, according to four sources. The imports would allow New Delhi to intervene more effectively in the market to drive down wheat prices that stoked inflation to a 15-month high in July.  The government is exploring the possibility of imports through private trade and government-to-government deals. The decision will be made cautiously,  one of the sources told Reuters, when asked about wheat imports from Russia. India has not imported wheat through diplomatic deals in years. The last time India imported a significant amount of wheat was in 2017, when private traders shipped in 5.3 million metric tons. The government's plan to import Russian wheat is one of the supply-side measures being considered to bring down prices of key commodities like fuel, cereals and pulse along with an extension of rural schemes to ease the impact of inflation on the poor, two of the sources with knowledge of the matter said. Sources did not want to be named as the discussions are private and the final decision might be weeks away. India's finance, trade and government spokespersons did not reply to emails and messages seeking comment. Last month, Sanjeev Chopra, the most senior civil servant at the federal food ministry, said there was no proposal to import wheat from Russia. LOW WHEAT STOCKS Although India needs only 3 million to 4 million metric tons of wheat to plug the shortfall, New Delhi might consider importing 8 million to 9 million tons of wheat from Russia to have a far bigger impact on prices, another source said. Since the war in Ukraine last year, Russia has become India's second biggest seller of goods mainly on account of discounted oil purchases by New Delhi.  Russia has indicated its willingness to offer a discount on prevailing market prices. There are no restrictions on the export of food commodities from Russia,  one official said. India is also importing sunflower oil from Russia and settling payments in U.S. dollars and is planning to use the same approach, the official added.  India can easily secure a discount of $25 to $40 per ton from Russia. This will ensure that the landed cost of wheat remains significantly below local prices,  said a dealer based in Mumbai with a global trade house. Wholesale wheat prices in India surged around 10% over two months to a seven-month high in August on limited supplies. Wheat stocks at government warehouses were at 28.3 million tons on Aug. 1, 20% below the 10-year average.  Last year, India banned wheat exports due to lower output, and this year's crop is also expected to be at least 10% lower than the government's estimate.",

Rising wheat prices could contribute to food inflation and potentially complicate the efforts of both the government and the central bank to contain inflation.  In all key producing states, farmer supplies have nearly come to a halt. Flour mills are struggling to obtain sufficient supplies in the market,  said a New Delhi-based trader. Wheat prices at Indore in the central state of Madhya Pradesh rose by 1.5% on Tuesday to 25,446 rupees ($307.33) per metric ton, the highest since Feb. 10. Prices have surged by nearly 18% over the past four months. The government should release stocks from its warehouses into the open market to avoid potential shortages during the festive season, said a Mumbai-based dealer associated with a global trade house. As of August 1, wheat stocks in government warehouses stood at 28.3 million metric tons, an increase from the 26.6 million metric tons recorded a year earlier.  Imports are necessary to lower prices. The government cannot increase supplies without imports,  the dealer said. India is considering cutting or even abolishing a 40% import tax on wheat and lowering a limit on the amount of wheat stocks millers and traders can hold, Sanjeev Chopra, the most senior civil servant at the federal food ministry, said last week. Wheat output rose to a record 112.74 million metric tons in 2023, up from 107.7 million metric tons a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.

The average retail price of tomato in the country has jumped five times over the past two months to about \u20b9136 per kg now, according to the consumer affairs ministry data. The average price of tur/arhar has gone up 9% in these two months, the data showed.102511870Sitharaman highlighted measures initiated to augment supplies of essential commodities and soften blow to consumers. These steps include timely releases of onion and pulses from the buffer stock, imposition of stock limits to traders, wholesalers and retailers, monitoring of stocks declared by entities to prevent hoarding, changes in trade policy instruments like the rationalisation of import duty, tweaks in the import quota and restrictions on exports of select commodities.Following government orders, the National Cooperative Consumers' Forum of India and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India have also procured tomatoes from producing states for easy supplies to consumption centres, the minister said. Government has also carefully calibrated import policy for different pulses, imposed stock limits on tur and urad and released tur from the buffer stock in a targeted manner,  she added.Retail inflation rose to 4.81% in June from a 25-month low of 4.31% in the previous month, as price pressure in the food segment jumped to 4.49% from 2.96%. Some experts said elevated tomato prices may have exerted greater pressure on food and headline retail inflation in July than in the previous month.They, however, expect food inflation to ease once the Kharif harvest improves farm supplies around October.A Crisil report last week said the current risk to inflation emanates from excess rain-led damage to vegetables and crops in the well-irrigated northern and western India.  The prices of cereals, pulses and, in the near term, vegetables, remain a key monitorable,  it added.Sitharaman informed the Lok Sabha that wholesale price inflation in key agricultural inputs like fertilizers, insecticides and pesticides dropped gradually in the June quarter from a year before.",

        "articleBody": "The recent spike in tomato prices has been driven by a raft of factors, including crop seasonality and heavy monsoon downpours, and the government has taken a series of steps to address inflationary pressure in essential commodities, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told Parliament on Monday.In a written reply in the Lok Sabha, the minister said white fly disease in Kolar district of Karnataka, heavy monsoon showers in parts of northern India and logistics disruptions in isolated areas in the wake of floods are also to be blamed for the sudden surge in tomato prices.The minister also said prices of pulses like arhar have gone up due to lower production this year.The average retail price of tomato in the country has jumped five times to about Rs 136 per kg over the past two months, according to the consumer affairs ministry data. The average price of tur/arhar has gone up 9% in two months, the data showed.Sitharaman highlighted various measures initiated by the government to augment domestic supplies of essential commodities and soften blow to consumers. These steps include timely releases of onion and pulses from the buffer stock, imposition of stock limits to traders, wholesalers and retailers, monitoring of stocks declared by entities to prevent hoarding, changes in trade policy instruments like the rationalisation of import duty, tweaks in the import quota and restrictions on exports of select commodities.Following government orders, the National Cooperative Consumers' Forum of India (NCCF) and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) have also procured tomatoes from producing states for easy supplies to consumption centres, she said.\u201cGovernment has also carefully calibrated import policy for different pulses, imposed stock limits on tur and urad and released tur from the buffer stock in a targeted manner,\u201d the minister added.Retail inflation rose to 4.81% in June from a 25-month low of 4.31% in the previous month, as price pressure in the food segment jumped to 4.49% from 2.96%.Sitharaman informed the Lok Sabha that wholesale price inflation in key agricultural inputs like fertilizers, insecticides and pesticides dropped gradually in the June quarter from a year before.To protect vulnerable sections of society from price rise, the government is implementing the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana under which grains are provided free of cost to around 800 million beneficiaries of National Food Security Act, Sitharaman said.Similarly, the One Nation One Ration Card scheme has been implemented for nationwide portability of ration cards to address the difficulties of migrant workers and others, she said.Beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana are provided a subsidy of Rs 200 per each cooking gas cylinder of 14.2 kg each for up to 12 refills a year, she added.",

        "articleBody": "Onion prices have increased almost 10% in the past one month, mainly due to lesser kharif sowing in main producer states of Maharashtra and Karnataka, although an official said the government has enough buffer stock to keep price rise under control. All India wholesale consumer price of onion stood at \u20b92,068.51 per quintal on August 3, up from \u20b91,893.56 on July 3. Year on year, the price has increased 4.86%, data from the consumer affairs ministry show.  Onion prices are expected to firm up as lower output is expected from the kharif crops since monsoon rains have not been adequate in Nasik, Pune and Ahemdnagar districts,  said Nikhil Sule, an onion farmer from the area.Area under onion farming had reduced in the last rabi season as well, according to a Crisil report that estimated the acreage to be 3-5% lower than the previous year, resulting in  approximately 6% lower output on year . The rating agency attributed the fall in rabi acreage to  25-27% lower realisation witnessed by farmers in the previous season . A senior official from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, however, said the central government has procured a buffer stock of 300,000 tonnes this year, 20% more than last year. This stock will come in handy for interventions when the prices go up,  the official said.The person attributed the slight increase in prices in recent weeks to the upcoming festive season, and said that retail prices of onion will not go beyond \u20b940 per kg this year.In 2022-23, the government had maintained 251,000 tonnes of onion as buffer stock.The buffer stock is maintained under the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) to meet any exigencies in case rates go up significantly during the lean supply season.",

Real GDP growth data for the last quarter of FY23 reaffirmed the ability of the Indian economy to grow on the strength of its domestic demand and investment despite a rise in global uncertainties and moderation in global output,  it said in its monthly economic report for June.",

        "articleBody": "India\u2019s growth prospects remain intact in FY24 on the back of improved monsoon showers, solid fiscal performance, continued expansion in manufacturing and services sectors and vigorous capital expenditure spending by both public and private sectors, the finance ministry said on Thursday. Indian economy\u2019s domestic dynamics continue to be strong. Real GDP growth data for the last quarter of FY23 reaffirmed the ability of the Indian economy to grow on the strength of its domestic demand and investment despite a rise in global uncertainties and moderation in global output,  it said in its monthly economic report for June. Growth momentum gathered in this quarter is likely to be sustained in the June 2023 quarter. However, price of such stability and growth is eternal policy vigilance, it noted.On inflation, the ministry said that inflationary pressure has significantly declined in the June 2023 quarter compared to the corresponding quarter last year and has entered the tolerance band of the RBI. But surge in food prices has led to sequential increase in food inflation in the month of June. The core inflation has also been softening since the beginning of the June 2023 quarter, indicating a restoration of overall price stability in the economy. However, the recent spike in the prices of \u2018fruits,\u2019 \u2018vegetables,\u2019 and \u2018pulses and products owing to weather-related disruptions has led to a sequential increase in food inflation for the month of June 2023. As inflation has been reined in only recently while threats of supply-side shocks, including El Nino, persist, the RBI and the government continue to be guarded for appropriate and timely policy response,  it said.The report also outlined the importance of fiscal consolidation along with narrowing of current account deficit for avoiding the challenge of a rising twin deficit. The government's progress towards achieving its fiscal target for the year, along with the presence of favourable external sector indicators during the June 2023 quarter, reaffirm the macroeconomic stability of the economy. While both the merchandise exports and imports contracted during the June 2023 quarter, the decline in imports was larger than the fall in exports in absolute terms, leading to a narrower merchandise trade deficit on a YoY basis. A smaller merchandise trade deficit and a consistent service trade surplus augur well for a narrower current account deficit in relation to GDP during the June 2023 quarter,  the review said.Despite adverse global developments, India\u2019s exports are also expected to perform well, driven by strong performance in services exports, the report further said. Increased digitisation drive, growing preference for remote working and increased proliferation of Global Capability Centres are expected to further increase India\u2019s services exports. Accompanied with an easing of supply chains and a decline in global commodity prices, the trade deficit is expected to improve further in the coming year. ",

State-run warehouses were expected to hold 13.5 million metric tonnes of rice, however the total also included 24.6 million metric tonnes of rice and 13 million metric tonnes of unmilled rice. ",

        "articleBody": "India's rice stocks were at nearly three times its target at the start of August, two government sources in the world's second biggest producer country said on Thursday. Coupled with the new season crop that is due to start trickling into the market by October, the surplus will raise market hopes of New Delhi relaxing a recent export ban. The world's biggest rice exporter last month ordered a surprise halt to non-basmati white rice exports, its largest category, driving prices to multi-year highs. Indian rice stocks, including unmilled husk varieties at state warehouses, totalled 37.6 million metric tons on Aug 1, the sources told Reuters.  We are quite comfortable in rice,  said one of the sources, who asked not to be identified.  We are in the tail end of the 2022-23 rice marketing year, and as you can see, our stocks are more than adequate. And then the next crop the round the corner.  Stocks held as of Aug 1 include 24.6 million metric tons of rice and 13 million metric tons of the unmilled variety, the sources said. State-run warehouses must have 13.5 million metric tons of rice, including strategic reserves of 2 million metric tons for the quarter beginning July 1, according to local government rules. Indian farmers, who typically start planting rice in the rainy months of June and July, will start harvesting the new season crop from October. New season purchases by India's state-run Food Corporation of India (FC), the main state-run grain buyer, would bump up rice inventories at state granaries. FCI bought 84.6 million metric tons of rice paddy from domestic farmers during the 2022-23 marketing year, yielding around 57 million metric tons of rice. Indian farmers harvested a record 135.5 million metric tons of rice in 2022-23, according to the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. Indian farmers have planted 23.7 million hectares with summer-sown rice so far, according to the farm ministry's latest data, up 1.71% year-on-year, as crucial monsoon rains revived in July and helped farmers accelerate sowing. India is likely to receive below-average rainfall in August due to the El Nino weather pattern, after an above-average monsoon in July helped farmers accelerate crop planting. Still, rice-growing states in eastern India could receive surplus rainfall in August, according to the weather office.  A good crop would force FCI to buy large quantities of rice from farmers, further boosting stocks at government granaries, B.V. Krishna Rao, president of the Rice Exporters Association, told Reuters. The export ban would increase domestic supplies and bring down rice paddy prices to the government-set support or guaranteed price of Rs 2,183 per 100 kg, compelling FCI to buy more, he said.  The government is already holding more rice than required under buffer norms,  Rao said referring to the state-set target.",

        "articleBody": "India G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant on Thursday made a strong case for food waste prevention programmes globally to reduce food insecurity and mobilise private funding for research in sustainable agriculture. Kant was addressing the maiden Global Food Regulators Summit 2023 here.  This is the first time a meeting of this nature is being held during India's G20 presidency. We feel strongly that locally adapted crops are significant for the transition towards resilient agriculture and food systems,  he said. To strengthen research, collaboration and public awareness of green crops, the G20 in its agriculture ministerial meeting, launched millet and other ancient grains international research initiative called Maharishi. The former bureaucrat said the world is passing through a critical time as one-third of the world is in recession, and 75 countries of the world are facing a global debt crisis. Also, there is a major crisis of food, fuel and fertiliser in several countries.  The need of the hour is not only to focus on the immediate crisis and short-term measures but also for all countries to make their food systems more resilient in the long run,  he said and urged the global food regulators to consider encouraging the cultivation of alternative crops beyond the major grains. He also talked about India's initiatives to popularise the use of millet. He informed that not a single meal is served at programs being held during India's presidency. This, he said, is being done to promote alternative crops. He further said:  It is important to mobilise private funding towards research and development in climate resilient and sustainable agriculture...it's important to ensure the protection of the most vulnerable groups through targeted social protection programmes such as food subsidies . Kant also emphasised the increasing cooperation among government, private businesses and international partners, so that nutritious production systems, which ensure proper food security, are taken care of.  It's also important to implement food waste prevention programmes to reduce food insecurity. There is just too much food wastage in the world,  he said. India's G20 Sherpa stressed on the deployment of digital tools to enhance agricultural practices, such as using soil maps to increase the efficient use of fertiliser. He urged the gathering to utilise the summit platform for learning, strengthening networks to improve food safety and creating a mechanism for investing in food safety in a sustainable way. This summit is an endeavour of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) under the aegis of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) to create a global platform of food regulators to exchange perspectives on strengthening food safety systems and regulatory framework across the food value chain.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: An 80-country coalition including India, China and South Africa has begun reaching out to Arab countries and least-developed nations to build pressure on the developed economies to ensure food security for developing nations.The alliance of G33, African Group and the ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) group at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has proposed a new method to calculate subsidies given to purchase, stockpile and distribute food to ensure food security for developing and poor nations.It has also proposed that exports of foodgrains from public stocks to needy countries be allowed for international food aid and humanitarian purposes.The alliance is keen to get more support for its proposals, officials said. The cosponsors of the proposal are reaching out to 6-7 LDCs and the Arab Group who have given support from the floor,  an official said.103913920The coalition has suggested that a permanent solution for public stockholding should account for inflation and be based on a recent reference price. At present, the external reference price (ERP) used for calculating subsidies is based on 1986-88 prices. Production of staples has been hit in many countries and they are now concerned about their food security. Our proposal is crucial for such producers especially at a time when global food prices are rising,  a second official said.They have suggested a new methodology to calculate the subsidies by either accounting for  excessive inflation  in the ERP or calculating the ERP based on the last five years excluding the highest and the lowest entry for that product. ERP is the average price of base years 1986-88 and has not been revised for decades.The proposal assumes significance in the wake of the developing and poor countries seeking a change in the WTO's agriculture rules - a permanent solution - to ensure policy space for their food security programmes ahead of the WTO's 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13) next year in Abu Dhabi.At present, they have a peace clause that protects them from legal disputes if the subsidies breach the de minimis level (10% of the total value of production of the product) but is subject to conditions such as anti-circumvention.The grouping has also proposed to amend the anti-circumvention clause in the Bali Ministerial Declaration of 2013 as per which developing countries that procure food stocks for security  do not distort trade or adversely affect the food security of other members .",

The government's targeted measures, including adjusting duties and tightening monetary policy, helped reduce core inflation. Consumer food price inflation eased to 9.9% in August from 11.5% in July.

        "articleBody": "In its monthly economic review for August published on Friday, the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) said that the prices of selected food items that drove the inflation rate above 7 per cent in July are on the retreat.  The calibrated measures taken by the Government, including adjustments in the duties of many critical inputs and monetary policy tightening, helped to reduce core inflation,  the DEA said in its report. In its report, the department specified that the government's targeted measures for specific crops, including build-up of buffer, procurement from producing centres and subsidized distribution enabled easing of inflation in the country.Amid growing food inflation in major economies inter alia France, Germany, Japan, South Africa, and UK, India on the other hand saw a dip in its retail inflation. As of August, consumer food price inflation eased to 9.9 per cent from 11.5 per cent in July. Vegetable inflation, however, surged in both July and August due to various factors including a sudden price rise in tomatoes and other food items, due to crop specific and weather-related factors like rain deficiency in the country. Nonetheless, the average inflation during April-August 2023, was 5.6 per cent, which is within the RBI tolerance limit of 2-6 per cent.   103856876Meanwhile, the economy's outlook report highlighted that the monsoon deficit in August could impact both Kharif and Rabi crops which requires assessment. However, it is a relief that the monsoon deficit of August has been partially plugged in September, the report added. Despite a 10 per cent deficient monsoon this year, vis-a-vis June-September, The kharif sowing (excluding cotton) is 0.8 per cent higher than the corresponding period last year, as of September 15. As per the economic review, normal or excess rains were received in around 83 per cent of the country\u2019s area. While the sown area under pulses and oil seeds remains lower than year ago period, the sowing of kharif rice has emerged as major contributor to the growth with 2.7 per cent higher than 2022.   103856936The DEA's outlook did mention an emerging concern which is the recent run-up in oil prices.  But, no alarms yet,  it said. Oil prices hovered near 10-month highs this week, as a bigger-than-expected draw in US oil stockpiles along with weak US shale output reinforcing fears of tight crude supply for the rest of 2023.Global benchmark Brent crude futures climbed 6 cents, or 0.1%, to $94.40 a barrel on September 20, staying near the highest since November of $95.96 hit on the previous day.Earlier this week, industry data showed U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell last week by about 5.25 million barrels, Reuters reported. As per a Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. rejoined the $100-a-barrel oil club, raising its forecast for crude back to triple digits as worldwide demand hits unprecedented levels and OPEC+ supply curbs continue to tighten the market.The DEA's outlook remains bright for FY24 amid continued momentum in economic activity.  In sum, we remain comfortable with our 6.5 per cent real GDP growth estimate for FY24 with symmetric risks,  it said. ",

In September alone, demand indents are expected to be lower than 2.5 lakh bales against planned 3.21 lakh bales due to slow order placing by Maharashtra,  IJMA Chairman Raghav Gupta told PTI.",

        "articleBody": "The jute industry is concerned over a threat of a 30-50 per cent production cut in three months till November, compared to the same period last year, because of a low demand for packaging material for foodgrains from various states, a senior official said on Tuesday. The Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA) has appealed to the Centre for a revision in the sixth (revised) supply plan issued by the Food & Public Distribution department. Foodgrain producers have to use jute as a packaging material to a certain extent.  In the current jute season from September to November 2023, the actual demand indent placement is lower by 30-40 per cent. In September alone, demand indents are expected to be lower than 2.5 lakh bales against planned 3.21 lakh bales due to slow order placing by Maharashtra,  IJMA Chairman Raghav Gupta told PTI. For the months of October and November, the indents are likely to be about 1.48 lakh bales against over 2 lakh bales as per the August plans, he stated.  But, in terms of capacity utilisation, our production cut will be to the tune of 30-50 per cent, unless indents are not revised upwards  Gupta said. Furthermore, the sudden cancellation of indents by the Chhattisgarh government for October and November has dealt a severe blow to the industry, IJMA claimed in its presentation to the government. As a consequence of the underutilised capacity in jute mills, manufacturers have initiated production cutbacks, a move that could significantly impact the pricing of raw jute, which is currently hovering below Minimum Support Price (MSP) levels, former IJMA chairman Sanjay Kajaria said. The instability in raw jute prices poses a threat to farmers, who may not receive adequate compensation for their produce, especially during the upcoming new jute crop harvest, he said. In light of these challenges, the IJMA has sought restoration of the cancelled indents by the Chhattisgarh government. The association has also urged the advancement of orders for 2 lakh bales for the upcoming RMS 2024-25 season to November 2023. These measures are seen as critical to ensuring the uninterrupted operation of jute mills across West Bengal during the festive season of Durga Puja. About 2.5 lakh workers are engaged in mills that produce about Rs 7000 crore worth of jute products and the lion's share goes into food grain packaging.",

India imported 17.55 lt of edible oil in July 2023.WheatHowever, as the prices of wheat saw an increase of 4% on NCDEX in the last one month, the government has reduced the stock limit on wheat for wholesalers and big chain retailers bringing it down to 2,000 tonnes from 3,000 tonnes. They will be expected to align with the new norms by October 12. The increase in spot prices could eventually reflect in the retail prices, Chopra added.The move is aimed at taming increase in prices. In June, the government, for the first time in 15 years, imposed a stock limit on wheat till March 31.",

Domestic consumption and investment demand are expected to continue to spur economic growth, it said.102955481The report stated that the maintenance of macroeconomic stability is paramount to keep interest rates from rising too much and to maintain steady economic growth. This would underscore the \u201crelative attractiveness of India as a zone of performance and promise for domestic and international investors\u201d. \u201cIn the given circumstances, policies that contribute to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability constitute macroeconomic stimulus,\u201d it added.This is particularly important at a time when stock prices have started correcting as sovereign bond yields have risen in much of the advanced world in August. Also, geopolitical and geo-economic concerns have not abated, and they may be \u201can enduring reality for quite some time\u201d, he added.Rural demand sustained sequential momentum in the June quarter, as reflected in the sales of fast moving consumer goods and two-and-three-wheelers. Increased minimum support prices and prospects of healthy kharif crops will further add strength to the rural demand going forward, it added.Driven by a spike in price pressure in food, retail inflation hit a 15-month peak of 7.44% in July but core inflation stayed at a 39-month low.\u201cRussia\u2019s decision to terminate the Black Sea Grain deal, along with dry conditions in major wheat-growing areas, caused the price spike in cereals. While domestic factors like white fly disease and uneven monsoon distribution exerted pressure on vegetable prices in India,\u201d the report said.The external sector, however, requires a closer watch to strengthen merchandise export growth in the face of slowing global demand, it said. Services exports continue to do well and are likely to continue to put up a good show as the preference for remote working remains unabated, typically manifested in the proliferation of global capability centres.",

        "articleBody": "India's import of edible oils increased to nearly 142 lakh tonnes during the 2021-22 marketing year ended October from 43.65 lakh tonnes in 2002-03, the government said on Friday. In a written reply to Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Food and Consumer Affairs Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti said,  India imported around 43.65 lakh tonnes of edible oils during oil year (November-October) 2002-03, which increased to 141.93 lakh tonnes in oil year 2021-22.    The domestic production of edible oilseeds increased marginally. However, domestic consumption/demand for edible oils has been increasing at a pace faster than that of production due to growth in population and improvement in the living standards of people i.e. around 10 lakh tonnes per annum,  she said.  Therefore, the minister said that the domestic production of edible oils is insufficient to meet the demand and the shortfall, which is around 55 per cent at present, is met through imports.  During 2021-22, domestic edible oil production stood at 116.5 lakh tonnes and imports at 141.93 lakh tonnes. The total consumption/ demand was 258.43 lakh tonnes, the data showed.  India imports edible oils mainly from Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.  In reply to a separate query, Jyoti said the total stock of rice in the central pool as on July 1, 2023 stood at 253.49 lakh tonnes against buffer stock norms of 135.40 lakh tonnes, which is adequate to meet the domestic requirement under the Public Distribution System (PDS) and other welfare schemes.  Answering another query, the minister said that  as on July 1, 2023, the total covered capacity available for keeping the Central Pool Stock with Food Corporation of India (FCI) & State agencies is 733.12 lakh tonnes (FCI owned & hired 371.94 LMT + State agencies 361.19 LMT) against the stock position of 554.94 lakh tonnes.

        "articleBody": "Onion prices have increased almost 10% in the past one month, mainly due to lesser kharif sowing in main producer states of Maharashtra and Karnataka, although an official said the government has enough buffer stock to keep price rise under control. All India wholesale consumer price of onion stood at \u20b92,068.51 per quintal on August 3, up from \u20b91,893.56 on July 3. Year on year, the price has increased 4.86%, data from the consumer affairs ministry show.  Onion prices are expected to firm up as lower output is expected from the kharif crops since monsoon rains have not been adequate in Nasik, Pune and Ahemdnagar districts,  said Nikhil Sule, an onion farmer from the area.Area under onion farming had reduced in the last rabi season as well, according to a Crisil report that estimated the acreage to be 3-5% lower than the previous year, resulting in  approximately 6% lower output on year . The rating agency attributed the fall in rabi acreage to  25-27% lower realisation witnessed by farmers in the previous season . A senior official from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, however, said the central government has procured a buffer stock of 300,000 tonnes this year, 20% more than last year. This stock will come in handy for interventions when the prices go up,  the official said.The person attributed the slight increase in prices in recent weeks to the upcoming festive season, and said that retail prices of onion will not go beyond \u20b940 per kg this year.In 2022-23, the government had maintained 251,000 tonnes of onion as buffer stock.The buffer stock is maintained under the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) to meet any exigencies in case rates go up significantly during the lean supply season.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi: The retail prices of wheat and rice have again increased to Rs 29.59 per kilogramme and Rs 40.82 per kg, respectively in July, Parliament was informed on Wednesday. Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, in her written reply to the Lok Sabha, said the retail prices of wheat and rice are continuously changing and the government is closely monitoring the prices.  The average retail price of wheat in January was Rs 31.58 per kg, which reduced to Rs.28.74 per kg in May. Thereafter, the average retail price of wheat has again increased to Rs 29.59 per kg in July, she said.  In case of rice too, the average retail price has increased to Rs 40.82 per kg in July from Rs 38.09 per kg in January.  The minister said the government has taken various steps from time to time to augment domestic availability and stabilize the prices of essential food commodities.  These steps, inter-alia, include releases of wheat and rice under OMSS(D) from the buffer to cool down prices, imposition of wheat stock limits, monitoring of stocks declared by entities to prevent hoarding and restrictions on exports of the commodity, she added.  Replying to a similar query, Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Ashwini Kumar Choubey said the retail prices of rice, wheat and atta have increased on year-on-year basis by 10.5 per cent, 5.2 per cent and 8.5 per cent, respectively.  Among vegetables, the all-India average retail price of potato is about 12 per cent lower than that of last year, while the price of onion about 5 per cent higher than last year, he said.  The price of tomato has increased in recent weeks on account of a combination of factors like crop seasonality, white fly disease in Kolar, instantaneous arrival of monsoon rains in northern part of the country, which adversely affected tomato crops in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, and logistics disruptions in isolated areas due to heavy rains, he added.  In order to check the current increase in prices of tomato and make it available to the consumers at affordable prices, the minister said the government has started the procurement of tomatoes under Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) and is making it available at a highly subsidised rate to consumers.",

        "articleBody": "The Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) has sought a \u201cclear policy direction\u201d from the government on setting up new ethanol distilleries, saying policies prioritising procurement of ethanol from grain-based distilleries in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh have affected the viability of sugar-based ethanol manufacturers in these states.Sugar-based ethanol manufacturers in Bihar and MP have been forced to supply ethanol to southern states, which is causing them huge losses as they have to bear the high transportation costs, ISMA chief AdityaJhunjhunwala told ET. One sugar-based ethanol supplier from Bihar was asked to supply to the southern states. However, the transport charges given by the OMCs are less than the actual cost of transport incurred by the ethanol suppliers,  Jhunjhunwala said.In a letter to the secretary, Department of Food and Public Distribution, ISMAsaid to achieve 20% blending by 2025-26, the government needs to incentivise ethanol from sugar by increasing its price and extending similar benefits as given to the grain-based distilleries.Oil marketing companies (OMCs) have signed long-term purchase agreements with the new grain-based distilleries in Bihar and MP. According to ISMA, the preference given to grain-based distilleries in these states has resulted in making ethanol supplies non-viable for the sugar-based distilleries from these two states. The supply (of ethanol) from juice has been less and below the government expectation due to the viability of the current price. Without the proper returns, the industry and the banks will not be able to make additional investments,  ISMA said in the letter. To achieve 20% blending by 2025-26, we need 1,200 crore litres of ethanol. In 2022-23, the sugar industry contracted for supply of 400 litres of ethanol, which needs to be taken to a minimum 800 crore litres and beyond. The new capacities will need a clear government policy and an investment of Rs 17,500 crore with a reasonable return on investment. Jhunjhunwala said the sugar industry needs a clear policy direction from the government for setting up new distilleries.  We will have to set up new green field projects to achieve the target of 20% blending. This will need a clear government policy and continuation of schemes like the interest subvention scheme and a price of Rs 69.85 per litre ,  said Jhunjhunwala.ISMA has demanded that like the grain-based distilleries, the government should either sign the tripartite-cum-escrow agreement (TPA) with sugar-based distilleries or buy the ethanol at ex-factory rate.Realising that the sugarcane molasses-based ethanol will not be sufficient for meeting the 20% blending target, the central government has started focussing on grain-based ethanol in grain surplus states like Bihar, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh.However, this year, the grain-based ethanol manufacturers are facing uncertainties about the supply of rice, the main raw material as Food Corporation of India has stopped supplying rice for ethanol manufacturing.",

        "articleBody": "The Punjab Cabinet on Saturday approved a revised mechanism for the distribution of packaged wheat flour or wheat at the doorsteps of beneficiaries by roping in fair price shop owners. The decision in this regard was taken by the council of ministers in a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann here, according to an official statement here. The distribution of 'atta' (wheat flour) or wheat shall be allowed in loose quantities, duly weighed, across the counter in ration depots (fair price shops) or in specially-sealed packets delivered at the doorstep of the beneficiary or the nearest motorable point, by the ration depot holder, said the statement. It will be a more dignified way of receiving packaged 'atta' as the beneficiary shall not be required to stand in long queues, especially in inclement weather conditions, it said. Last year, the AAP government's plans of starting home delivery of 'atta' was put on hold after the fair price shop owners moved the Punjab and Haryana high court as they were against the scheme to be implemented through newly appointed distribution delivery agencies. The government statement on Saturday said all mandatory requirements of biometric verification, handing over of printed weight slip to the beneficiaries and others will be ensured while the delivery. The home delivery service will introduce the concept of model fair price shops which will be run by 'The Punjab State Cooperative Supply and Marketing Federation Ltd', being the apex cooperative and preference provided under the National Food Security Act to cooperatives. The Punjab State Cooperative Supply and Marketing Federation Ltd run model fair price shops shall also engage smart transport services for supplying packaged wheat or packaged 'atta' at the doorstep of beneficiaries, it said. In another decision, the cabinet gave go ahead to the Punjab Crusher Policy 2023. As per the policy, there will be two main classes of crusher units --commercial crusher units (CCU) and public crusher units (PCU) adding that screening-cum-washing plants will also fall under the category of crushers units. The government shall, from time to time, notify a price, called the  Crusher Sale Price  (CSP), beyond which no mineral shall be sold by any unit. The CSP shall include the cost of mineral, transportation from mining site to the crusher unit, processing charges and profit and loading of mineral onto any permitted class of transportation vehicles. The cabinet also approved amendments in the Punjab Minor Minerals Rules 2013 to curb the menace of illegal mining and to increase the supply of minor minerals in the state. The cabinet also gave consent to a policy for providing relief to farm labourers due to loss of crops in case of natural calamity. As an amount is released to deputy commissioners for the crop damage, an additional 10 percent of the above amount will be provided to them out of the state budget to compensate farm labourers. This policy will be effective from May 1, 2023 and all the farm labourers' families who have no land (except residential plot) or those who have less than one acre of leased/ rented/ cultivated land will be eligible for it. In order to carve out a healthy and progressive Punjab by creating a mass movement of Yoga in the state, the Cabinet also gave green signal to recruit additional 14 supervisors (Yoga) and 200 trainers (Yoga) for CM's Yogashala Project. The cabinet also gave consent to enhance the monthly maintenance grant of 'dharmi faujis' (Sikh soldiers who had left their barracks in revolt after the Operation Bluestar in 1984) from Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000.  The decision has been taken in wake of the escalating market inflation, current scenario and increase in daily needs of these Dharmi Faujis,  said the statement. The cabinet also approved the adjustment of pending electricity bills worth Rs 8.50 crore related to 366 registered 'gaushalas' (cow shelters) including 20 government cattle ponds in Punjab from October 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023. The cabinet also gave nod to revive 39 posts of teaching faculty including five professors, 10 associate professors and 24 assistant professors of direct recruitment in nine departments of Government Dental College and Hospital, Amritsar and Patiala.",

        "articleBody": "The Congress on Sunday alleged that the Centre is  sabotaging  its Anna Bhagya guarantee in Karnataka and asserted that the 10 kg free rice scheme of its state government would be implemented at the earliest,  come what may . The Opposition party also asked why is that the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana is not a 'revdi (freebie)', whereas the Congress guarantee of 10 kg free rice through the Anna Bhagya 2.0 scheme  vilified and sabotaged . In a statement, Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh alleged that it is nothing but Karnataka's 'durbhagya' (misfortune) that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is  punishing the poor of the state for voting to secure their future . From January 1, 2023 till May 24, 2023, the BJP-led state government in Karnataka alone lifted more than 95 per cent of the rice procured by all state governments under the Open Market Sale Scheme (Domestic) at a rate of Rs 3,400 per quintal, presumably with  Modi-ji's 'aashirwaad' , Ramesh said.  Once, the Congress government was formed in Karnataka, as threatened by BJP president JP Nadda, this 'aashirwaad' has been withdrawn at break-neck speed,  he alleged. Ramesh argued that regardless of claims otherwise made by the Modi government, it is now  absolutely clear  that the order of June 13 by the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Food Distribution discontinuing OMSS(D) for states was targeted at mainly one state, Karnataka, that procured more than 95 per cent of all rice bought by state governments under the scheme this year.  Actually, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) had issued orders for sale of rice under OMSS (D) on June 12, 2023, based on the requests of the Congress-led state government in Karnataka made on June 6, 2023 and June 9, 2023. Yet a day later, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Food Distribution discontinued the OMSS (D) for states,  he said.  Clearly, this was targeted at sabotaging the implementation of the Anna Bhagya 2.0 scheme guaranteed by the Congress to the people of Karnataka,  Ramesh alleged.  Immediately, on June 14, the FCI general manager Karnataka withdrew the earlier order of sale of rice on June 12, he said  Not only that, the Chairman and Managing Director of Food Corporation of India (FCI) in a press conference on June 23, 2023 said that conditions will be placed such that private traders cannot sell to another state. Isn't this a clear case of sabotage?  Ramesh said He alleged that this  brazen move of the Modi government  not only targets the additional 5 kg free rice guaranteed by the Congress government in Karnataka, bringing it to a total of 10 kg free rice, it also affects the basic entitlement of 5 kg that is being given to an additional 39 lakh below poverty line beneficiaries by Karnataka government beyond what is already allocated by the Union government under the National Food Security Act. The fact is that the FCI has more than enough stocks to meet Karnataka's and the country's needs but the Modi government is trying its very best to close every single avenue for the Karnataka government to fulfil its guarantee to the people of Karnataka, Ramesh alleged. If there is a depletion of rice stocks as claimed by the Modi government, why is it that the allocation and lifting of rice from the FCI's central pool stock for ethanol production and blending of petrol continues at the rate of Rs 2,000 per quintal, he asked.  Why is it that 1.5L MT of rice is allocated for production of ethanol this year if stocks have depleted? Is ethanol production more important than the food security of the people of Karnataka?  Ramesh said. This is not the first time that the prime minister has opposed the schemes of the Congress that benefit the poor, he claimed.  On August 13, 2013, then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh opposing the Food Security Bill. It is the same National Food Security Act implemented by the Congress party that came to the rescue of the country's poor at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic distress,  Ramesh asserted. Under the renamed package of Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana, 80 crore people got free food grains and pulses, he said in his statement and added that this would not have been possible without the architecture of the National Food Security Act and the Public Distribution System implemented by the Congress-led UPA government.  Why is that the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana is not a 'revdi', whereas the Congress Guarantee of 10 kgs free rice through the Anna Bhagya 2.0 scheme is vilified and sabotaged?  he said. Ramesh stressed that the Congress government in Karnataka will do everything possible to ensure the rights of the people of Karnataka are protected, and the guarantee of Anna Bhagya 2.0 with 10 kg free rice is implemented at the earliest,  come what may . A day after the Centre refused to give rice to Karnataka, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Saturday had said the state had invited quotations from three central agencies to supply rice for the Anna Bhagya scheme offering five kg extra rice to the BPL families. He had said the negotiations for prices were underway with these agencies. Siddaramaiah had also slammed the Centre for refusing to provide rice to his government for the scheme which is one of the five guarantees, that was supposed to start immediately after the Congress came to power in Karnataka.",

The Congress staged protests in all district headquarters of the state against the BJP-led Centre for allegedly denying rice for the Karnataka government's Anna Bhagya scheme. On the other hand, several BJP leaders including former CM Basavaraj Bommai were detained while holding protests in some parts of the state against the Congress government's alleged failure to provide 10 kg rice to each member of the BPL family. The Centre said it cannot provide the additional five kg though Karnataka said it was ready to buy it from the central institutions such as Food Corporation of India, Central Warehousing Corporation and NAFED. Recently, the union government discontinued the sale of rice and wheat from the central pool under the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS) to state governments.  I have received demands for rice from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh. Various states keep demanding rice in huge quantities. But we have refused (to give rice to) all of them,  Goyal said.  We want that the rice stock which is with India (government)...so that there is no rise in price (of rice) in the country and the rice is sold at a cheaper rate in the open market in every nook and corner of the country.

The Chief Minister, after declaring the state as totally e-governed, said it would not only create a network of government offices and citizens, but would use technology for Kerala's development and empower the people by bridging the digital divide. It would also fast track the journey towards a knowledge society and economy with total e-literacy, he said at the 'Total e-Governance Kerala' event.  By the term governance what the present government means is total commitment to fulfil the promises it has made to the people. The government and governance are reaching out to the people more and more, he said.  The service delivery has been made people-oriented and corruption-free and public utilities have become people-friendly. These transformative changes have been felt by people in the last seven years,  the Chief Minister said. The government will not stop and rest on its laurels and would focus on ensuring that services reach the masses instead of the people having to knock on the doors of departments for the same.  This can be ensured by leveraging new technology, and that is exactly what the government is focusing on,  Vijayan said. One such  bold step  in that direction was making internet access a citizen's right by rolling out the KFON (Kerala Fibre Optic Network) project, he said and added that it would make access to the internet affordable or free of cost. He also listed out the other government initiatives -- like a single-window portal called e-Sevanam for delivering as many as 900 services -- for ushering in e-governance which would soon be extended to taluk-level offices.  In panchayats, delivery of as many as 250 services has been made online,  the Chief Minister said. Setting up the country's first digital university in the state and launch of the digital science park project worth Rs 1,500 crore were the other major steps taken by the government to bridge the digital divide and bring about total e-governance, he said. Noting that the total e-governance declaration coincided with the second anniversary of the LDF government, Vijayan said his administration has turned the occasion into an opportunity to unveil a series of pro-people projects including the 100-day programme, instead of seeing it as an occasion for just celebrations. In his welcome address, State Chief Secretary V P Joy said with Kerala becoming the first complete e-governance state in the country, there won't be any delay in providing services to people from government departments and offices. He said the changes resulting from the implementation of e-governance would reflect in all sections of society and it would be a decisive factor in social progress. The delivery of all vital services has already been digitised, covering all key domains including health, education, land revenue, documentation of properties, public distribution system and social security payouts, a government statement said. An exhibition featuring digitisation of service delivery by various government departments is going on at Kanakakunnu here and entry to the same, which is free for the public, would close on May 27, it said.",

        "articleBody": "The ban on exports of wheat will continue as India has to ensure adequate supplies of the foodgrain for its domestic market and keep the inflation at check, Union minister Piyush Goyal said on Thursday. He said that the procurement of wheat has started and the numbers for the first week of buying are  very  satisfactory.   I could believe that we will have a good harvest despite the unseasonal rains...We do believe that we will have to ensure adequate supplies for the Indian market and once the procurement period is over, we believe that it will be important that inflation is also contained in the country and therefore it is important that the wheat exports continue to remain banned,  the commerce and industry and consumer affairs, food and public distribution minister told reporters here.  He is here on a two-day visit to meet leaders and businesses in order to enhance economic ties between India and Italy.  India, the world's second-largest wheat producer, banned wheat exports in May 2022 as part of measures to control rising domestic prices.  State-owned Food Corporation of India (FCI) Chairman and Managing Director Ashok K Meena has recently stated that estimated higher wheat production this year will ensure sufficient supplies for both government procurement and general consumption in the Indian market.  The government has projected a record wheat production of 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June), as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.  On April 1, FCI godowns would have a wheat stock of 84 lakh tonnes.  FCI is the government's nodal agency that undertakes the procurement and distribution of food grains for the PDS (public distribution system) and welfare schemes.  Further, the Centre has relaxed quality norms for wheat procurement in Punjab, Chandigarh, Haryana and Rajasthan to prevent distressed sale as well as protect the interest of farmers.  The recent untimely rainfall, hailstorm and high velocity wind have damaged the standing wheat crop, which was ready for harvest, in some parts of these states. These state governments had demanded the relaxation in procurement norms.  Currently, wheat procurement is underway in Madhya Pradesh, while it has been delayed in other states because of untimely rains. State-owned Food Corporation of India (FCI) along with state agencies undertake the procurement of wheat.   After the field survey, we have relaxed the quality norms for procurement of wheat in Punjab, Chandigarh, Haryana and Rajasthan in order to reduce hardship of farmers and to avoid distressed sale of wheat,  Subodh Kumar Singh, Additional Secretary in the Union Food Ministry, said on March 11.  The Centre has asked these state governments to deduct the imposed value cut from the minimum support price of Rs 2,125 per quintal while making a payment to the farmers.  The government has purchased 13.20 lakh tonnes of wheat till April 10 of the ongoing 2023-24 marketing year (April-March) mostly from Madhya Pradesh. About 1,000 tonnes of wheat has been procured in Punjab, while 88,000 tonnes in Haryana in the same period, as per the food ministry data.  Asked about the lower procurement in Punjab and Haryana, the official said,  the procurement was delayed due to the untimely rains. The arrivals were not huge and therefore the procurement has not been much. However, in the next few days, the procurement of wheat in these two states will pick up.   The Centre aims to procure 34.2 million tonnes of wheat in the ongoing 2023-24 marketing year (April-March), higher than 19 million tonnes achieved in the previous year.  Last year, wheat procurement had declined due to a slight fall in production owing to heat wave and unseasonal rains. However, this year the production is estimated to reach a record of 112.2 million tonnes.",

Loss in wheat production will be very, very minimal, states are preparing the reports. We are still yet to get the report.  The secretary stressed that lower temperatures were observed over the past two weeks and going forward, any high temperatures are not anticipated over the next two weeks.  So, these are extremely conducive at this stage of the cultivation,  he added.He said,  We are anticipating this wherever harvest has not yet taken place in areas like UP (Uttar Pradesh) and Bihar where the weather actually helps this particular crop a lot. Chopra said,  So, while there may be some production loss in Punjab and Haryana, which is now being estimated, but the gain we'll have in the yield in other parts of the country, particularly in the areas where there is late sowing. He added,  So, we find that we would probably end up about the same figure of 112 million tonnes of production or in the worst-case scenario, there will be a negligible drop in the production.  With regard to the procurement we have a target of 342 lakh tonnes of procurement for this particular rabi and having discussed with the state govt and dept of agriculture we feel that this particular target is achievable and are hoping that procurement will pickup,  Chopra said.Chopra said,  For sugar, our estimates are about 386 lakh tonne production. We are anticipating that little bit of shortfall because of some unseen reasons in Maharashtra and it could go down by 2-4 lakh tonne. Talking about prices of pulses and edible oil, the secretary said that a committee in the department of consumer affairs is monitoring the situation of pulses. Pulses prices are fairly range-bound, he said, adding,  We have not seen any sharp spurt in recent days. The mechanism put in place by the department of consumers affairs is working very well. Edible oil prices are also very stable. None of the edible oils like groundnut, mustard, palm oil or soyabean have seen any appreciable jump over the past couple of months.  ",

Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the Centre's nodal agency for procurement and distribution of foodgrains through the Public Distribution System (PDS). The difference between the economic cost and central issue price of foodgrains is paid as a food subsidy to the agency.  A big part of the Union government spending comes from outside the budget, which is referred to as internal and extra-budgetary resources (IEBR). IEBR constitutes the resources raised by public sector units through profits, loans and equity. An IEBR provision of Rs 1.45 lakh crore has been made for FCI in the Budget for the 2023-24 financial year.  According to the ministry,  The purpose of an outlay of Rs 1.45 lakh crore shown as Internal and Extra Budgetary Resources (IEBR) for FCI in the Budget Estimate (BE) FY'2023-24 represents an indicative estimate of short-term working capital requirement of FCI to defray costs of procurement/managing PDS operations.   The ministry explained that food subsidy is released to the FCI on reimbursement basis from the Budgeted outlay after procurement and distribution of essential commodities through the PDS. Pending its receipt, FCI manages its working capital requirements or the costs arising from procurement operations, establishment, freight, storage inventory carrying charges, etc., by availing cash credit.  This cash credit is arranged through different modes like from consortium of banks, short-term loans (up to 90 days), ways and means advance, etc, it said and added that the costs from working capital requirements are included in the food subsidy released to FCI from the Union Budget.  Further, the ministry said as part of the government's commitment to budgetary transparency and proactive disclosure, the budget documents for FY '2023-24 discloses an indicative working capital requirements for FCI for the next fiscal  upfront .  However, the actual utilisation against the indicative estimate is expected to be need-based and in a phased manner. This has been a continuing arrangement made available to FCI, it said.  For instance, in the current 2022-23 fiscal, the indicative IEBR outlay was Rs 89,425 crore in the Budget Estimates, which has been scaled down to Rs 56,935 crore in the Revised Estimates, on account of lower carrying cost of reduced inventory, it added.  According to the ministry, higher IEBR estimate for FY24 reflects FCI's anticipation of higher levels of procurement including incidental expenses due to increased inventory of essential commodities in the year.   The government further reiterates that the provision for food subsidy in the Budget for FY 2023-24 is adequate to cover all anticipated costs pertaining to projected PDS requirement of essential commodities for distribution amongst the beneficiaries,  it added.",

        "articleBody": "Food Minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday termed the CBI investigation into alleged corruption in Food Corporation of India (FCI) a  wake-up call  for the state-owned firm and asserted that those involved in corrupt practices will not be spared. FCI - the government's nodal agency for procurement and distribution of foodgrains - would follow the principle of zero tolerance for corruption, the minister said.  Goyal stated this while delivering the inaugural address at the 59th Foundation Day of FCI here, an official statement said.  It's a wake-up call for the organisation and those found involved in corrupt practices will not be spared, Goyal was quoted as saying while referring to the ongoing investigation into the alleged cases of corruption in FCI.  He said FCI will follow the principle of zero tolerance for corruption and there is a need to ensure that there is not a single corrupt employee in FCI.  Goyal directed the officials to institutionalise a mechanism wherein whistleblowers should be rewarded.  He asked all officers and staff of FCI to report any incident of corruption. Goyal said there is a need to transform, reform and reinvent FCI and its entire ecosystem, including the ration shop dealers. He described the recent development of corruption in FCI as  unfortunate .  On January 11, the CBI launched 'Operation Kanak' on alleged corruption in FCI, conducting searches at 50 locations in Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi after arresting a DGM-rank officer from Chandigarh.  The CBI booked a total of 74 accused in the FIR after a six-month long undercover operation to identify suspects in the syndicate of officials, rice mill owners and middlemen, among others who were allegedly indulging in corrupt practices.  Goyal also said the transformation of FCI should be done on a fast track mode so that the organisation can continue to help the people, the poor and farmers of the country.  The minister also directed the Secretary, Department of Food and Public Distribution to monitor the transformation of FCI and Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) every week and to update him on the status on a fortnightly basis.  He said strict action has to be taken against the officers who do not cooperate with or delay the transformation process.  As per the statement, Goyal praised the way FCI carried out the world's largest food supply chain system, especially during the pandemic to ensure seamless supply of foodgrains under 'Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana' (PMGKAY). He said despite the pandemic, no one slept hungry in the country.  Goyal said India has set a global example in the areas of food security, strengthening economic scenario, controlling inflation and others.  He mentioned that the rice procurement figures for the year are good and hoped for a robust wheat procurement in the coming season as well.  Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra also directed FCI CMD Ashok KK Meena to ensure a system of eliminating corruption and providing an efficient and transparent service to the people.  According to the CBI FIR, an organised syndicate of FCI officers charged bribes ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 4,000 per truck unloaded at godowns from private millers to cover up lower quality grains supplied by them and to extend other favours.  The bribes were distributed among officers at every level reaching up to the headquarters in a well-defined percentage of cuts at each level, it alleged.  The FIR, seen by PTI, shows details of such bribe collection in many FCI depots across Punjab.",

On the other hand, the cumulative effect of the G20 Summit has been that of success in showcasing the strength of the country to the world. I am not concerned with the praise in editorials. For me, the real happiness lies in the fact that my country is now confident that it can host any such event in the best possible way,  the prime minister said.He said in this event, Union Ministers and the senior officers were occupying the rear seats while ground-level functionaries were at the forefront.  I like this arrangement as it assures me that my foundation is strong,  Modi said.During the programme, the prime minister asked the functionaries to sit informally and share their experiences in their respective departments. In routine office work one does not come to know the capabilities of their colleagues, he said.This, Modi said, puts one's performance in a broader perspective.  Once we know the efforts of others, that pushes us to do better. Today's programme is about mazdoor ekta zindabad. We all are mazdoor (labourers).

All this showed India standing strong and reaching everywhere in times of need,  Modi said.The prime minister underlined the need for global exposure in order to improve further and said global approach and context should underline all work.The interaction saw the participation of around 3,000 people, who have contributed to the success of G20 Summit.It especially included those who have worked at the ground level such as cleaners, drivers, waiters and other staffers from various ministries.

Canada has mortgaged its foreign policy for the sake of political sports land,  said Sunil JakharWelcoming Centre's decision to suspend visa services in Canada, Jakhar said,  If the Trudeau govt will continues to support the separatist forces, the Indian government for the time being keeping careful consideration has suspended visas to develop a system so that India's integrity and sovereignty can be maintained by avoiding these forces entering into India, especially Punjab.  Punjab BJP chief also acknowledged the fact that some people may be facing challenges as their relatives are living in Punjab and said that the integrity of India is more important than the concerns of any individual.  The unity, integrity and brotherhood of the country is more important than the concerns of any individual, whatever is happening is the Canadian government's mistake. Justin Treadu has given a statement without facts or an official record. As they sow seeds, so reap the fruits. Pakistan got hit by inter-gang rivalry and its economy got ruined, Canada is also following the same path.  He said that despite the fact that the Financial Action Task Force sent a notice to Nijjar, the Canadian government provided a safe haven for Nijjar.He lauded the Indian government's foriegn policy and said that we have differences of opinion in domestic policy, but when it comes to foreign policy, we stand united Local politics has no impact on foreign policy. There are many political parties in India. We have differences of opinion in domestic policy, but when it comes to foreign policy, we stand united,  he said.

India's stand on terrorism is clear, there is no 'if-but' about terrorism policy in India. There are no shades of grey in terrorism. There is no religion, country, or sect of terrorism, terrorism is terrorism.  He added. The statement from the Punjab BJP President Sunil Jakhar came amid tensions in India-Canada relations after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday alleged that the Indian government was behind the fatal shooting of Hardeep Singh Nijjar.Nijjar, who was a designated terrorist in India, was gunned down outside a Gurdwara, in a parking area in Canada's Surrey, British Columbia on June 18.Justin Trudeau during a debate in the Canadian Parliament, claimed his country's national security officials had reasons to believe that  agents of the Indian government  carried out the killing of the Canadian citizen, who also served as the president of Surrey's Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara.The allegations made by the Canadian Prime Minister and foreign minister were rejected by the Ministry of External Affairs in India which dubbed the statements as absurd.

The games will showcase a wide range of events, including regional specialties like dragon boat racing and kabaddi, as well as popular sports like cricket and squash. China is expected to dominate the medal table, followed by Japan and South Korea. The games will also see the participation of North Korea, which skipped the Tokyo Olympics due to border closures caused by the pandemic. ",

        "articleBody": "The Asian Games are an attention grabber. For starters, they involve more participants than the Summer Olympics. Organizers say more than 12,000 will be entered when the opening ceremony takes place Saturday in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou. This is more than the 10,500 expected for next year's Paris Olympics. The giant numbers are partly due to the staggering array of events with many regional specialties, sports, and games you won't find in the Olympics. And there's also cricket, which appears headed to the Olympics as soon as 2028 in Los Angeles, and certainly for 2032 in Brisbane, Australia. And there's squash, which has tried several times for Olympic recognition. The regional fare includes dragon boat racing, sepaktakraw - sometimes called  kick volleyball - wushu, a Chinese martial art, and kabaddi, a popular contact sport on the Indian subcontinent. There is also the non-Olympic martial art of ju-jitsu, and kurash, a form of wrestling popular in central Asia. To this, add a long list of what organizers call  mind sports  from bridge to chess to xiangqi (Chinese chess) to esports. Of course, there are the old standbys seen in every Olympics like track and field, swimming, or volleyball - and the usual grandiose opening and closing ceremonies. Nine sports will offer qualification spots for the Olympics - archery, artistic swimming, boxing, breaking, hockey, modern pentathlon, sailing, tennis, and water polo. However, most of the 481 events offer a chance for smaller delegations to win medals, which is often impossible at the Olympics. China won almost 300 overall medals at the last Asian Games in Indonesia in 2018. At the bottom of the table, Syria and Nepal won a lone medal each. Bhutan and Bangladesh were among nine delegations that didn't win any. China will dominate the medal table as it has for the last 40 years, followed by Japan and South Korea - Asia's other powers. The vast region stretches from Lebanon on the Mediterranean, through central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, to North Korea with organizers saying 45 nations or territories are entered. Organizers have said 191 participants from North Korea will be on hand. North Korea closed it border early in 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic and skipped the Tokyo Olympics, which were delayed a year until 2021. The Asian Games were also pushed back a year from 2022 because of the pandemic. According to South Korea's Unification Ministry, the last time North Korean athletes appeared in an international sports competition was January 2020, when North Korea competed in the Asian Football Confederation's under-23 soccer championship. If you like political intrigue, there may be plenty of it. The self-governing island of Taiwan will be on hand in China, which claims the democracy as a breakaway province that it has vowed to reclaim it. Known as the Republic of China, the island is officially listed as Chinese Taipei in the Olympics and Asian Games and marches under a white flag adorned with the Olympics rings. Its red, blue and white flag is in not allowed. Taiwan, with only 23.5 million, is a relative sports power in the region and finished seventh in the overall medal standings in Indonesia. The games also begin amid an open power struggle between International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach and Kuwait's Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, a long-time IOC member who is often described as the  kingmaker  who helped Bach win the IOC presidency in Buenos Aires in 2013. The Switzerland-based IOC openly intervened in July to invalidate the presidential election of the Olympic Council of Asia. It has also suspended Sheikh Ahmad from the IOC. The election was ostensibly won by Kuwait's Sheikh Talal Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, the younger brother of Sheikh Ahmad. The elder sheikh is the former 30-year president of the OCA, an organization that was created by his father. The IOC says it will continue to recognize Randhir Singh of India as interim president of the OCA until new elections are held. Bach will attend the opening ceremony in Hangzhou and is sure to have talks with Singh. The biggest event of the games might be a possible India vs. Pakistan gold-medal game in men's cricket on Oct. 7, which would be one of the most-watched global sports events all year. It comes just as cricket's world cup is also underway. China will again dominate diving, and several of China's top swimmers - fresh from the world championships two months ago in Fukuoka, Japan - will shine. The field in gymnastics is weakened since the world championships in Antwerp, Belgium, clash with the Asian Games. The biggest winner at the Asian Games might be South Korea esports star Lee Sang-hyeok, who is also known as  Faker.  If he wins gold he will be granted an exemption from military service. Tottenham Hotspur soccer forward Son Heung-min also bypassed a 21-month military stint because of a government exemption when South Korea won the gold medal in soccer at the 2018 games in Indonesia - although Son still had to do three months of basic training.",

The police made the submission before Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Harjeet Singh Jaspal during the argument on whether to frame charges against Singh in the case.  Singh was not exonerated by the oversight committee. The committee had given the recommendations, not the decision... Nowhere has it stated that these allegations are not substantiated or are false,  special public prosecutor Atul Srivastava told the court. He urged the court to frame the charges against Singh, saying even a mere gesture can constitute a crime under section 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the Indian Penal Code. The Delhi police had filed a charge sheet against the six-time MP on June 15 under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354A (sexual harassment), 354D (stalking) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).  Singh appeared before the court during the proceedings of the case on Saturday. Delhi police will resume its arguments on September 23 on the charges against Singh. The Union Sports Ministry had constituted an oversight committee headed by Indian boxing great M C Mary Kom to investigate the allegations levelled by women wrestlers against Singh after their protest in the national capital. Its report was not made public but a copy was given to the Delhi police who are probing the allegations against Singh. The court had on July 20 granted bail to Singh and suspended Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) assistant secretary Vinod Tomar. They were never arrested in the case.",

        "articleBody": "New Delhi, Eleven ministries are yet to finalise their sector-specific accessibility guidelines for people with disabilities, the government said on Thursday. The information was shared by the Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry with the parliamentary standing committee on social justice and empowerment. The parliamentary panel report was tabled in Lok Sabha on Thursday.  The ministry said the departments of Law and Justice, Consumer Affairs and Telecommunication are following the guidelines of MEITY and MoHUA respective to their domain related to people with disabilities.   Other than this, five Ministries namely MoHUA, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Department of Sports have notified their guidelines in the official gazette and are currently underway of draft and final notification in The Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016 Rules,  the ministry told the parliamentary panel.  The ministry said that the  remaining eleven ministries are at various stages of finalisation of their respective sector-specific accessibility guidelines .  The Committee, in response, said it finds that while progress has been made in terms of framing Accessible India Campaign (AIC) specific guidelines, training, etc, yet the objectives of the scheme are far from being realised.   For instance, so far out of the 20 ministries/departments entrusted with the task of formulation of Sector Specific Standards of Accessibility, only nine ministries have done it so far and 11 are yet to finalise their guidelines,  the panel said.  The Committee said it would like to stress the fact that AIC seeks to build a truly inclusive and barrier-free environment for People with Disabilities (PwDs) and hence such a lackadaisical attitude of some of the government agencies is  very disheartening .  It urged the department to accord utmost priority to removing any impediments in the successful implementation of the scheme and to continuously remind the remaining departments to finalise their guidelines expeditiously in coordination with the Ministries/states/UTs so as to enable the PwDs to avail the intended benefits seamlessly  Also, the Committee, chaired by MP Rama Devi, said that it has recommended a proactive approach for the exemption of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on aids and appliances for PwDs as such an action would make aids and appliances more affordable.   The Committee is of the opinion that aids and appliances are essential items for persons with disabilities for their daily mobility to gain access to the opportunities of education, employment or enjoyment of other rights or the discharge of duties as responsible citizens,  it said.   Hence, the committee would like to reiterate their earlier recommendation and urge the Department to continue with sustained efforts to prioritise the removal of GST on aids and appliances, as without them many PwDs would be forced into living a restricted and confined life or in a state of seclusion,  the panel said.",

        "description": "With the 2024 Paris Olympics a year away, sports governing bodies are divided on how to treat Russian athletes. Some sports have lifted bans on Russian athletes and are allowing them to compete as neutral competitors without a flag or national anthem. Most of the sports that allow Russians to compete follow the IOC's advice and prefer to call them  individual neutral athletes.  ",
        "datePublished": "2023-07-24T21:17:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "A year before the Paris Olympics, and nearly a year-and-a-half since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, officials governing many of the sports on the 2024 program are still split on how to treat Russian athletes. Increasingly, various governing bodies are allowing them back into Olympic qualifying competitions as neutral competitors without national flags or anthems. Most sports initially barred Russians from competing soon after last year's full-scale invasion. The International Olympic Committee strongly backs those moves even as the body itself says it hasn't decided if athletes from Russia and ally Belarus can compete at the Paris Games. However, the IOC has delayed action on the one sport whose qualification it runs in-house, boxing. Most of the sports which have allowed Russians to return also followed IOC advice on its preferred name -  individual neutral athletes  - and to keep barring those who are under contract with the military or who have supported the war publicly. The IOC also recommends blocking Russia from team sports like soccer or basketball. Ukraine is opposed to any Russians competing. Since last year, Ukrainian athletes and national teams have been boycotting competitions which allow Russians back in, a policy enforced in April by a government decree. Activists from Ukraine have been trawling Russian athletes' social media for pro-war posts that could disqualify them from competing. Here is a look at the situation for Russian and Ukrainian athletes in key sports on the Olympic program: Track and Field World Athletics excluded athletes from Russia and Belarus from competitions after the invasion of Ukraine. That remains in place  for the foreseeable future,  after a vote of the World Athletics council in March. President Sebastian Coe said at the time that deaths and destruction in Ukraine have only  hardened  his resolve to keep a ban in place. Swimming World Aquatics is one of the sports taking Russia's return slowly. It has said it favors Russia and Belarus returning to its sports - swimming, diving, water polo, artistic swimming - but set up a task force that won't report back with suggestions until late July. That means no Russians at the world championships this month in Japan. Tennis The big exception among Olympic sports in tennis. The men's and women's tours didn't exclude Russian or Belarusian players when Russia launched its invasion. They even fined tournaments including Wimbledon which did impose restrictions. Ukrainian players continued competing but often refuse to shake hands with Russians or Belarusians. Aryna Sabalenka, who is from Belarus and won the Australian Open in January, has been questioned about her past support for Belarus' authoritarian leader, President Alexander Lukashenko. She has said she does not support the war. Russian and Belarusian players still can't enter national team competitions like the Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup. The International Tennis Federation hasn't made a final decision on the Olympics but has plenty of time because qualification is decided by the June 2024 world rankings. Gymnastics Gymnasts from Russia and Belarus will be allowed to take part in sanctioned competitions as  individual neutral athletes  from the start of 2024. That timetable pushed their return beyond the world championships in early October in Belgium. Russian gymnasts have been some of the most vocal supporters of the war. Days after the invasion, Ivan Kuliak wore a pro-war  Z  symbol on a competition podium while standing next to a Ukrainian athlete. He was suspended for a year. Other Russian gymnasts appeared on stage at a rally in support of the war, and Olympic gold medalist Nikita Nagornyy heads a military youth organization in Russia. Boxing This is the one sport the IOC has total control over, but that doesn't mean a quick decision. The IOC is running Olympic boxing in Paris and qualifiers in-house after a long-running feud with the International Boxing Association and its Russian president. Qualifiers were held at the European Games in June but the host nation, Poland, refused to allow any Russian athletes. A plan to qualify Russians via the Asian Games has been suggested but not confirmed. That could mean any Russian return only happens at two last-chance qualifying tournaments in early 2024. Combat Sports Sports like fencing, judo and taekwondo have seen some of the bitterest disputes. Ukraine boycotted the world championships in both judo and taekwondo, taking a big hit to its Olympic qualifying hopes, after Russians were allowed to compete. In judo the  neutral  delegation of Russian athletes included some previously listed by the Defense Ministry as holding military ranks. The International Judo Federation, which had last year opposed excluding any Russians, said all the Russian competitors were employed at a state sports training facility.  Ukraine is also boycotting some events at the fencing world championships in Italy, another key Olympic qualifier. The International Fencing Federation - whose former president, Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, said last year he was stepping aside from his duties - has been a strong supporter of reintroducing Russian and Belarusian fencers this year. Competition organizers in several European countries canceled their events in protests, disrupting the Olympic qualifying calendar, and the European Championships were stripped of their status as a qualifier when Poland refused to allow Russians to compete. Team Sports Don't expect to see Russian teams competing in soccer, volleyball, basketball or handball at the Paris Olympics. The IOC still backs excluding Russia from team sports and no Olympic sport has yet defied that regulation. In some events, like men's basketball and soccer, Russia has already missed its last chance to qualify. The IOC also recommends a ban on  team events in individual sports  like relay races or the team all-around in gymnastics. Other Sports Russia is boycotting weightlifting events after its team refused to sign a waiver accepting the conditions for  neutral  status, including a promise to  continue to abstain from expressing any support to the war.  Belarusian athletes signed and are competing. Some sports like archery have delayed things further. World Archery is exploring plans for a Russian return but said in February it would be  very unlikely  this year, potentially restricting Russia to a limited number of events in the months just before the Olympics. Canoeing is planning to allow Russians back in some Olympic qualifiers but is giving the local organizers of each competition a veto. Rowing will only allow single sculls and pairs, no larger Russian crews.",

        "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: In an ugly war of words, Sakshi Malik accused former wrestler and BJP leader Babita Phogat of siding with the government during their protest against the WFI chief while the latter claimed that the Rio Games bronze medallist has become a  Congress' puppet .Malik and her husband Satyawart Kadian had on Saturday asserted that the wrestlers' protest was not politically motivated and in no way it was inspired by Congress as it was BJP leaders Babita and Teerath Rana, who had helped them in taking police permission for the sit-in at Jantar Mantar.On Sunday, quoting their Saturday video, Malik tweeted that they had taken a dig at Babita and Rana about how they tried to use the wrestlers for their selfish motives but the satire was not understood for the lack of sense of humour. In the video (posted on Saturday), we had commented how Teerath Rana and Babita Phogat were trying to use wrestlers for their selfish motives and how when the wrestlers were in trouble, they opted to sit on the lap of the government.  We are definitely in trouble, but the sense of humour should not become so weak that a joke cracked on the powerful could not be understood,  the tweet read further.Babita, who had mediated between the wrestlers and the government during the grapplers' three-day protest in January, tweeted a long reply to Malik and claimed that she had nothing to do with their protest since she was against the agitation on road from day one. It pained me and also made me laugh when I saw the video posted by my younger sister and her husband. Let me make it clear that the letter, seeking police permission, does not carry my signature. I have nothing to do with that,  she wrote, completely pulling herself away from the protest. From day one, I was not in favour of any protest or demonstration. I had maintained that I have faith in the PM and the judiciary and the truth will come out. I repeatedly told them to meet Prime Minister or Home Minister for a solution but you saw solution with Deepnder Hooda, Congress and Priyanka Gandhi, who themselves were accompanied by rape accused people. .......your video will make people understand that how shameful it was on your part to start a march on the inauguration day of the new parliament building and then talking about immersing medals in river Ganga. People of this country have understood that you have become a Congress' puppet. Now is the time that you reveal your real motive because people are asking questions now,  wrote Babita.Meanwhile, Rana denied the allegations that he had used the wrestlers for selfish motives. The wrestlers came and met me (before staging the protest) and they told us that they were being exploited. We said we are with our sisters and daughters. I am with the athletes in the fight for justice. I was there with them before and I am now as well,  Rana said in a video.The video was shared in the WhatsApp group that was created to disseminate information to media during protest. The Rana video was later deleted from the group. Look, wrestlers are the pride of the nation and the respect of sportspersons is uppermost on the mind of the BJP, and I also respect them a lot. I have always supported sportspersons,  said Rana in the video.The country's top wrestlers including Malik, Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia have accused outgoing Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh of sexual harassment and demanded his arrest.Kadian had claimed in their saturday video that if they had taken the extreme step of immersing their medals in Ganga, it would have led to violence.Responding to that, Rana said,  Well, there was no such talk that it (immersion of medals) would lead to violence. There was anger among the sportspersons and they took a decision that they would immerse their medals in river Ganga...but the country's sentiments were that the athletes should not take such a step.

The submission of nominations for elections will commence on June 23 and conclude on June 25, which will be followed by preparation and display of the nominations, while the scrutiny of the nomination papers will take place on June 28.  The candidates will be able to withdraw their nominations between June 28 and July 1, following which the final list of contesting candidates will be put up on July 2.  In his notification issued on Tuesday, the returning office wrote,  Whereas, the last date of receiving two nominations from each State/UT for constituting the electoral college has been fixed as 5.00 p.m of 19th June,2023, all the recognised Wrestling Federations of the states/UTs under the ratified constitution of the W.F.I and the guidelines of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, Govt. of India are hereby called upon to nominate two (2) persons each of the respective associations who are the members of executive body of such State/UT Units, for the purpose of constituting the electoral college for the ensuing general election to elect members of the Executing Committee.   The nominations must be sent... under the signature and seal of the respective Federations by the President and the General Secretary, but not later than 5.00 p.m. of the 19.6.2023.   The WFI elections will be held for the post of president, senior vice-president, four vice-presidents, secretary-general, treasurer, two joint secretaries, and five executive members.  It was widely speculated that the elections would take place on July 4 after the IOA appointed Mittal, the former Jammu and Kashmir High Court Chief Justice, as the returning officer on Monday.  The main task before the retired judge would be to decide which rival faction within the state bodies will participate in the polls, as two different state bodies in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Karnataka have reportedly sent names for inclusion in the voters list for the elections.  WFI had dissolved Karnataka, Haryana and Maharashtra at its Executive Committee meeting in June 2022 for various reasons, including  corruption and mismanagement .  Another big issue in the elections is whether family member or associates of outgoing WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh will be allowed to contest elections.  Sports Minister Anurag Thakur had assured the wresters that the government will not allow any of the Brij Bhushan's relative to contest the polls.  It remains to be seen what happens if the eligible candidates associated with Brij Bhushan file their nomination for the elections.  Brij Bhushan's son Karan was vice-president in the previous WFI setup and is also associated with the UP wrestling association. His son-in-law Vishal Singh is the president of the Bihar Wrestling Association.  They are both eligible to contest as state body representatives.",

The decision that has been taken in this fight for justice, that if something is not done by May 21, if our demands (to arrest Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh) are not met during that period then we will have to take a big call,  said Vinesh to the media.Vinesh said that their demand to get Brij Bhushan Singh arrested.On their future in wrestling amid protests, Vinesh said,  We will compete. If God presents an opportunity before us then we will definitely play. We are still trying to train as much as possible during the protests, trying to find time for it and plan our training schedule,  said Vinesh.Ahead of the farmers' march coming from various states in support of the protesting wrestlers in the national capital, security has been beefed up at the Delhi-Ghazipur border on Sunday.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha had announced holding nationwide protests including in Delhi in support of the wrestlers.According to an SKM statement on Saturday, on May 7, several leaders of the organisation from Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh will visit the protest site at Jantar Mantar and extend support to the protesting wrestlers.Speaking on the allegation against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, farmer leader Joginder Singh, at the Tikri border, said,  They are in power and it is very difficult to stand against a person who is misusing his power and position for so long, but we will fight against it.  Government's job is to stop us but we will go to the place where we want to go. If they try to stop us, it will cost them. There are no plans of staying here, if government and administration stop us, then we'll have to stay here,  he told ANI.Notably, SKM had spearheaded the year-long farmers' protest on the borders of the national capital against the now-repealed farm laws.On April 23, Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat and Sakshi Malik returned to the protest site at Jantar Mantar, claiming that six women wrestlers, and a minor, filed a sexual harassment complaint against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh at Connaught Place Police Station but Delhi Police did not register an FIR. The protesting grapplers also demanded that the Sports Ministry make the findings of the Oversight Committee public.Delhi Police filed two FIRs on April 28 following the notice by the Supreme Court.Earlier this year, prominent wrestlers came forward to lead a protest against the WFI chief, following which the Union Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports announced the formation of an 'oversight committee' to probe allegations against the WFI, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and some coaches.The protesting wrestlers have made it clear that they won't move until they get justice and Brij Bhushan is removed as the WFI chief and put behind bars.",

The athletes said Modi had previously welcomed and celebrated their successes but had now ignored their plight. The Sports Ministry has not disclosed the findings of a six-member committee that investigated the allegations. ",

        "articleBody": " Why are you not listening to our 'Mann Ki Baat',  the protesting wrestlers asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday and sought his time to discuss the sexual harassment allegations against his party's MP and WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. Country's top wrestlers resumed their agitation against the wrestling federation's chief on Sunday, three months after they ended their sit-in protest following the formation of an oversight committee to probe into the serious allegations.  The Sports Ministry has not yet made public the findings of six-member oversight panel that submitted its report on April 5.  The wresters on Wednesday said they are surprised that PM Modi felicitates them and clicks pictures with them when they win medals but now he has turned a blind eye to their plight when they are on road, seeking justice.   PM Modi sir talks about 'Beti Bachao' and 'Beti Padhao', and listens to everyone's 'Mann Ki Baat'. Can't he listen to our 'mann ki baat'? He invites us to his home when we win medals and gives us a lot of respect and calls us his daughters. Today, we appeal to him that he listens to our 'Mann Ki Baat',  Rio Games bronze medallist Sakshi Malik said during a media interaction.  Interestingly, Malik drew analogy with Prime Minister's popular radio programme 'Mann Ki Baat' which is completing 100 editions and to mark the milestone, several programs are being organised by the government.   I want to ask Smriti Irani (Union Minister) why is she silent now? It's been four days that we are sleeping on road, enduring mosquito bites. We are not being allowed (by Delhi Police) to prepare food and train, why are you silent? I just want to say that you come here, listen to us and support us,  added Malik.  Malik feels may be their point is not reaching the Prime Minister.   Maybe our truth is not reaching him, so we want to meet him and let him know our issues.   An emotional World championship medallist Vinesh Phogat said, we don't have the (telephone) numbers (of relevant people) by which we can reach out to him so we are appealing to PM Modi through media to raise issues. Maybe he can then listen to your cries. Our souls are almost dead, maybe he will see.    He does his program 'Mann ki Baat' but has he, even for a minute given a thought to our 'mann ki baat, how much dilemma, does he think we face that daughters of the nation are sitting on the roads and are on the cusp of quitting wrestling by standing against a big criminal?   Vinesh also said that they will take out a candle light march later in the evening.   Maybe the authorities can't see, so we will take out a candle light march to offer some light. Maybe they can see that daughters of India, who are not just wrestlers but represent the feelings of many women, are out on the roads.  Tokyo Games bronze medallist Bajrang also appealed to the PM.   These are daughters of India appealing to you, please do justice with them,  he said.  We had brought wrestling mats for practice but we were not allowed, even we can't prepare our food here because there is no permission. Now, will we have to take permission even for breathing,  asked Bajrang.  He also added that efforts are being made by WFI chief's men to scare them.   A few people are trying to discourage us and scare us by narrating stories how Brij Bhushan got an adversary killed. But let me tell you that we are not going to get scared.   Vinesh also appealed to all athletes, across disciplines, to stand united with them.   Can't we put behind greed, fear and self interest behind? I appeal to all sports persons of the nation, Olympic medallists, national medallists and world championship medallists to come together and stay united.   If we come together, there is no reason why we can't be number one nation in Olympics one day. ",

Wrestlers protest unjustified. They were heard by the minister and the Ministry. The Minister sat with them in a meeting for over 12 hours. On their demand, a committee was formed. They further asked for the addition of another name that too was done! They cannot be protesting till the entire report is examined,  said a top government source. Sources said WFI wanted to hold its election, but it will not be allowed by the government till the Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh matter is sorted out. Till the matter is sorted out, the government will ask the Indian Olympic Association to look after the day-to-day matters of the association.  On their front, the government is putting a hold on the Wrestling Federation election. The government will ask Indian Olympic Association or set up a Committee of Administrators to run the matter till then,  said the source. The source further said,  The wrestlers are demanding that Anurag Thakur should have met them, but since the enquiry is ongoing and that the enquiry was set up by the Sports Ministry under Thakur. It would be unfair to meet the wrestlers at this stage. But the government, especially the Sports Minister has constantly engaged with the wrestlers. Earlier, the Minister gave them a hearing for over 13 hours before announcing the committee.  According to sources, Sports Minister Anurag Thakur had dropped his programme in Himachal Pradesh to join a meeting with protesting wrestlers. The wrestlers did not turn around in the morning but came late in the evening. Even then also Anurag Thakur cancelled all his appointments and waited for them and then the committee was announced. The committee was announced as per the demand of the wrestlers, and when they asked for an additional member, even that was honoured by the government,  added the source. Having waited for three months, star wrestlers like Vinesh Phogat, Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia again started their protest against WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh on Sunday and said that they took the step after alleging that no action has been taken in the matter and said that the FIR has not been registered against the WFI chief.Ace India wrestler Sakshi Malik broke down while interacting with the media as wrestlers protest at Jantar Mantar. We wanted to file a sexual harassment FIR against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. We got a complaint filed two days ago but FIR has not been registered yet. There are seven female wrestlers and one of them is a minor. We want the investigation to happen fast. It is a sensitive matter. We are being framed as liars which we cannot bear. We are waiting for two and a half months now but no one is listening. People are saying we are spent force that is why we are protesting. We just won a medal at CWG 2022,  Sakshi Malik told the media at Jantar Mantar.  It is being heard that we are finished, that is why we are protesting. For two and a half months the government has not taken any action. We cannot reveal the name of a minor. Otherwise, her name and career will get spoilt,  she added.Earlier in January this year, top Indian wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat, Ravi Dahiya and Sakshi Malik, held a sit-in protest in Jantar Mantar, demanding that Brij Bhushan be removed from the head office and Wrestling Federation of India be disbanded. They had accused the body and its chief of sexual harassment and mistreatment of wrestlers.Following the protest, in January, the Union Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports announced the formation of an 'oversight committee' to probe allegations levelled against the Wrestling Federation of India and its chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and other coaches. The committee was given the task of submitting a report on the issue to the Ministry.Olympic medalist Mary Kom is heading the Oversight Committee. Former wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, former shuttler Trupti Murgunde, SAI member Radhica Sreeman, former CEO of the Target Olympic Podium Plan Rajesh Rajagopalan and CWG gold medalist Babita Phogat are the other members of the Mary Kom-led committee.But in April, Punia had said that the wrestlers would go to court to protest against the report of the oversight committee appointed to investigate the matter and allegations put up by prominent Indian wrestlers against the WFI and its president Brijbhushan Sharan Singh.Speaking to ANI, Punia said,  I read an article in which one of the committee members said that the report has been submitted to the Sports ministry without his signatures. The member also expressed his/her disagreement with the report. If a committee member is not involved in report submission and disagrees with the report, how are we supposed to trust it?  We were not even informed that the report was submitted to the ministry,  he added.Punia also said that WFI should make public the statements given by female wrestlers in a sting operation to a private TV channel if it feels it is innocent and also, people get to decide who is right or wrong.The wrestler said that they (wrestlers) will start protesting once again and will even go to the high court as soon as possible. We have to carry on with our sport, but we will protest and go to the high court as soon as possible,  said Punia. ",

        "articleBody": "In a year when the Indian athletes will compete at the Asian Games and prepare for 2024 Paris Olympics, the Sports Ministry has got a fillip with the government allocating Rs 3,397.32 crore, an increase of Rs 723.97 crore, in the Union Budget here on Wednesday. The amount is more than the revised budget of the previous financial year (2022-23) when the ministry received Rs 2,673.35 crore, as against the actual allocation of Rs 3,062.60 crore.  One of the reasons for the reduced revised allocation for 2022-23 could be the postponement of the Hangzhou Asian Games, which will be held this year.  The ministry's flagship programme, 'Khelo India -- National Programme for Development of Sports' continues to be the government's priority, with it being allotted Rs 1,045 crore as against the revised allocation of Rs 606 crore during the previous financial year.  This is an increase of Rs 439 crore and points to the government's commitment to the programme, which over the years, has shown the potential to produce athletes for major global events such as the Olympics, Asian Games and the Commonwealth Games.  The Sports Authority of India (SAI), which takes care of organising national camps for athletes, providing infrastructure and equipment to athletes, appointment of coaches and maintaining sports infrastructure, among others, has seen a Rs 36.09 crore increase in its budgetary allocation from the previous year's revised expenditure of Rs 749.43 crore. Their allocation for 2023-24 stands at Rs 785.52 crore.  The National Sports Federations (NSFs) have received an increased allocation of Rs 45 crore, from previous year's revised budget of Rs 280 crore and will now get Rs 325 crore.  The National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA), affiliated to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), and the National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL), which earlier received funding from SAI, will now get it directly.  A provision has been made in this year's budget to provide NADA a funding of Rs 21.73 crore, while NDTL, which conducts the tests, will receive Rs 19.50 crore.  With countries across the world striving for sporting excellence and paying more attention to sports science and scientific training of athletes, this year's budget has also made a provision of Rs 13 crore for National Centre of Sports Science and Research.",

Formed by the Sports Ministry, the oversight committee is carrying out an enquiry into the allegations of sexual misconduct, harassment, intimidation, financial irregularities and administrative lapses of the WFI and its chief.  The allegations were levelled by prominent grapplers such as Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Ravi Dahiya.   Former wrestler Babita Phogat has been added to the panel of the Oversight Committee formed by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports to undertake the day-to-day administration of the Wrestling Federation of India,  the ministry said in a statement.

Sports Minister Anurag Thakur had earlier this month announced the formation of the committee to investigate the charges against the WFI chief and also manage the day-to-day affairs of the sports body.

Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat, Sarita Mor and Sakshi Malik, who staged a sit-in protest at Jantar Mantar for three days demanding the sacking of the WFI president, expressed disappointment that they were not consulted before the formation of the committee.   The ministry has no plans to reconstitute the oversight committee to probe the allegations against WFI chief Brij Bhushan Singh,  a ministry source told PTI on Wednesday.   We have formed a fair committee under Mary Kom which will go into the details of the matter,  said the source, adding that the government is unhappy with the wrestlers' behaviour as they went public with their reservations on the formation of the committee.97348745  According to sources, the protesting wrestlers consider the London Olympics bronze medallist Yogeshwar close to the WFI president. In fact, when Yogeshwar backed the under-fire Sharan, Vinesh had said that he was  sitting on WFI's lap.   The wrestlers had taken to twitter to express their dismay on Tuesday.  However on Wednesday, Bajrang clarified that the grapplers don't have an issue with Yogeshwar but they expected to be consulted before the members were finalised.   We would like to speak with the Sports Minister after the Republic Day celebrations. We don't have any problem with any members in the committee but we should have been consulted,  Bajrang Punia told PTI.  Asked if no names were discussed with them, Bajrang said,  A discussion had happened and these names came up but we were told to come back on the names after discussion.   But the names were announced before we replied in affirmative. Government should not be unhappy with us. What have we done, we are fighting for justice,  he added.  Apart from Yogeshwar, ex-badminton player and Mission Olympic Cell member Trupti Murgunde, ex-TOPS CEO Rajagopalan and former SAI executive director - teams - Radhica Sreeman are also member of the committee.  Both May Kom and Yogeshwar are also part of the the seven-member committee formed by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to probe the allegations of sexual harassment and corruption against the WFI chief.  Besides legendary boxer Mary Kom and wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, the IOA panel includes archer Dola Banerjee and Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWLF) president and IOA treasurer Sahdev Yadav.  The other members of the IOA committee are two advocates -- Talish Ray and Shlok Chandra -- besides former shuttler and IOA joint secretary Alaknanda Ashok, who is its vice chairperson.  The agitating wrestlers, including young Anshu Malik, Sangeeta Phogat and Sonam Malik among others, started the sit-in protest at Jantar Mantar here on Wednesday and demanded the sacking of the WFI chief.  The wrestlers had accused Sharan, who is also a BJP MP, of acting like a dictator and sexually harassing junior wrestlers.  The wrestlers did not reveal the identity of the athletes who faced sexual harassment.",

        "articleBody": "The Union sports ministry has asked the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) to suspend its activities, including its general body meeting scheduled for Sunday in Ayodhya, till an oversight committee takes charge of the body.This came a day after the government set up the oversight panel to examine allegations of sexual abuse and financial irregularities against WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh that were brought to light by prominent sportspersons recently.Singh who had earlier said that the emergency general body meeting of around 80 members will take up all issues raised by sportspersons, tweeted on Sunday evening that he was not  larger than the party.  He said his commitment to the BJP was unquestionable and asked his followers to not vent their anger on social media by posting objectionable content.The sports ministry also issued instructions to suspend WFI\u2019s assistant secretary, Vinod Tomar, who had openly backed Singh and accused the protesting wrestlers of a \u201chidden agenda\u201d.The government said Tomar\u2019s \u201ccontinued presence will be detrimental\u201d to the working of the oversight body. The ministry has yet to announce the names of the committee members.Many prominent wrestlers including Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Ravi Dahiya have accused Singh of harassment and intimidation. Singh has been heading the WFI for ten years now.The sports ministry on Saturday had directed Singh to stay away from the day-to-day affairs of the WFI.Singh was however present at a wrestling event in his bastion Gonda (in Uttar Pradesh) on the same day, a development that irked wrestlers who had called off their protest a few hours after talks with sports minister Anurag Thakur.Thakur said on Sunday that the ranking tournament for wrestlers in Gonda had been cancelled and that the body had been asked to reimburse those participants who had paid an entry fee.The decision to form an oversight committee, seen as a breakthrough in talks between the protesters and the ministry, was taken after a marathon meeting Friday night that lasted five hours between the sports minister and wrestlers in the presence of the sports secretary and DG, Sports Authority of India, ET has learnt.Back-channel talks with the wrestlers will continue, even as the ministry finalises the names of the members of the committee, sources said.According to those in the know, handling the issue was a challenge as the federation is an independent elected body and the ministry had to quickly find a solution to reassure wrestlers who had been protesting since Wednesday.The government also wanted to avoid a repeat of the suspension of the All India Football Federation (AIFF), a matter that went to the Supreme Court before the Under-17 Women's World Cup last year.Since there was no formal complaint or police action, the sports ministry was keen to understand the exact charges against Singh so that further action could be initiated, a source said.Even as the talks started on Thursday, the ministry also sought a response from the WFI within 72 hours, while also making efforts to stall public utterances by Singh.A six-term MP and a strongman from Gonda, 66-year-old Singh had threatened that there would be a \u201ctsunami\u201d if he was asked to quit.Sources said the Centre had made it clear that with the Republic Day closing in, the protests had to end soon for the festivities to take over.A wrestler told ET that Thakur had listened to their complaints patiently and had asked them to suggest names that could be considered for the committee.The second round of conclusive talks with the wrestlers were held on Thursday after Thakur cut short his programmes in Himachal Pradesh and rushed to Delhi to address the issue.\u201cThe minister told us that even the coaches who have been complained against will be asked to step aside till the investigation is complete. That was reassuring,\u201d another source said.Meanwhile, WFI has rejected all the allegations in an eight-page response to the ministry, and instead accused the players of pushing vested interests and of conspiracy against other states that wanted to develop in sports just like Haryana.",

It has decided to suspend Tomar,  with immediate effect, to ensure proper functioning of WFI .  The ministry said it has also directed the WFI to suspend  all ongoing activities with immediate effect , including the Ranking Tournament in Gonda, UP, Sharan's stronghold.  This comes a day after Sports Minister Anurag Thakur announced the formation of an oversight committee to probe the charges levelled by some of the country's top wrestlers, including Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Ravi Dahiya, against Sharan and his body.  Regarding Tomar, the ministry said in a letter, which is in possession of the PTI, that his presence will be  detrimental to the development of this high-priority discipline .   The Ministry has taken note of the reports about the functioning of the WFI, including the role of Shri Vinod Tomar and, has the reasons to believe that his continued presence will be detrimental to the development of this high-priority discipline,  the ministry said in the letter.  The aggrieved wrestlers had alleged that Tomar took bribes from athletes and was involved in financial corruption, helping him to build property worth crores.  According to sources, the ministry will announce the names of its oversight committee members on Sunday.  In a press release, the ministry said it  has communicated to the Wrestling Federation of India on Saturday that in view of the Government's decision to appoint an Oversight Committee to investigate the various allegations raised by athletes against the Federation, WFI will suspend all ongoing activities with immediate effect, unless the Oversight Committee is formally appointed and takes over the day to day functioning of WFI .  It added,  In view of the direction to suspend all activities immediately, the Sports Ministry has asked WFI to also cancel the ongoing Ranking Tournament in Gonda, UP.   In this regard, the ministry has also asked the WFI to return the entry fees charged to participants for the ongoing event.  The oversight committee of the ministry will have the powers to take all decisions on matters concerning Indian wrestling while also overseeing the day-to-day affairs of the federation.  Earlier in the day, the WFI had rejected all the allegations, including that of sexual harassment against its president, and claimed that the wrestlers' protest was motivated by a  hidden agenda to dislodge the current management .  The WFI denied all the charges in its response to the government's notice and asserted that  there is no scope for arbitrariness and mismanagement   in the federation.  The ministry had sought an explanation from WFI after the country's top wrestlers sat on a dharna and alleged that the federation chief sexually harassed women wrestlers and acts like a  dictator .  Before the wrestlers agreed to end their protest, the Indian Olympic Association had on Friday formed a seven-member committee of its own, headed by M C Mary Kom, to investigate the charges against Sharan.  The IOA panel was constituted even as the wrestlers' sit-in protest entered the third day.  Besides legendary boxer Mary Kom and wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, the panel includes archer Dola Banerjee and Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWLF) president and IOA treasurer Sahdev Yadav.  The IOA committee also has two advocates -- Talish Ray and Shlok Chandra -- besides former shuttler and IOA joint secretary Alaknanda Ashok, who is its vice chairperson.  The decision was taken during the IOA's emergency Executive Council meeting, which was attended by the likes of Olympic champion shooter Abhinav Bindra, Olympic bronze medallist Yogeshwar, along with IOA president PT Usha and joint secretary Kalyan Chaubey.",

For e-sports, the Department of Sports under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, has been notified as the nodal department.The government will soon publish rules for online gaming intermediaries and start public consultation on these rules, Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar said on Tuesday.  The rules, to be published by MeitY, will encourage innovation but ensure that there is no illegal content or service, Chandrasekhar said in a tweet. Sources said the upcoming budget is likely to bring more clarity, including taxation issues fced by online gaming companies.96552340 The centre is committed to ensure that the (online gaming) industry is provided with the necessary framework to flourish,  a senior official told ET. This will make it easier for industry to deal with regulation.  A nodal ministry for online gaming has been a long-standing demand of the industry and we welcome this move. This will make it easier to come up with uniform regulations and an eventual comprehensive central framework,  Roland Landers, CEO of the All India Gaming Federation (AIGF) said. Recently, IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the Centre would soon come up with a proper policy, and a new law, to deal with online gaming as all states have been unanimous in their concerns about the serious impact it was causing to society. The appointment of MeitY as the central regulatory authority will provide clarity and certainty to investors, industry and consumers,  said Joy Bhattacharjya, director general, Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports (FIFS). The decision is in line with the government's initiative to push for growth of the animation, visual effects, gaming and comics (AVGC) sector and making India a global hub for online gaming. We are sure that the online gaming industry will grow responsibly under MeitY's guidance. The industry is looking forward to working with MeitY in creating a well-balanced regulatory framework,  he added.In the absence of any central nodal agency and framework, the gaming industry was facing a backlash from some states which had clubbed online gaming with betting and gambling and had proposed a ban on online games of skill, leading to a series of litigations. In May, the Centre set up a seven-member task force to work on regulations for the online gaming industry and identify a nodal ministry to look after the sector's concerns. The task force submitted its report in October. The latest move is in line with the task force's recommendations. MeitY may act as the nodal ministry to regulate online gaming, except for the e-sports category on which the Department of Sports can take the lead,  the report said. This will also segregate e-sports from general online games.E-sports are online games that are played competitively in the form of tournaments and leagues. Some of them are digital or virtual versions of mainstream sports like cricket or football.On Tuesday, ET reported that the government, through the Ministry of Corporate Affairs' Investor Protection and Education Fund (IPEF), was planning to launch an outreach campaign to create awareness about cryptocurrencies and online gaming.",

The President of India, Droupadi Murmu, in exercise of the powers  conferred by clause (3) of article 77 of the Constitution  amended the rules governing Esports and asked the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Sports Ministry to include  e-Sports as part of multi-sports events .  There had been a growing demand for Esports to be included in the curriculum of multi-discipline events after it was included in the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games as a demonstration sport, meaning medals won in the sport were not counted in the official overall medals tally.  But following the President's notification, issued on December 23, that IT Ministry will be the nodal agency for online gaming-related matters and the sports ministry will have to include it in its curriculum, it has come as shot in the arm for Esports enthusiasts.  The International Olympic Committee (IOC) too is going big on popularising e-Sport with Singapore being confirmed to host the inaugural Olympic Esports Week in June next year.  This marks the next big step in supporting the development and integration of virtual sports with the Olympic movement and engaging further with competitive gamers.  The IOC had said in November this year that the Olympic Esports Week would showcase the best of virtual sports -- hybrid physical and simulated sports -- in the four-day festival from June 22 to 25, including exhibiting the latest technologies, panel discussions, education sessions and show matches.  IOC President Thomas Bach had said last month that the inaugural Olympic Esports Week would mark an important milestone  in our ambition to support the growth of virtual sports within the Olympic Movement .  The Indian DOTA 2 team had clinched bronze at the first Commonwealth Esports Championship held in Birmingham in August defeating New Zealand.  The sport will make its debut at the Asian Games to be held in Hangzhou, China next year.  Reacting to the report of its inclusion as a mainline sport, Lokesh Suji, director, Esports Federation of India and vice-president of Asian Esports Federation, said the efforts of the fraternity had finally borne fruit.   We have been constantly working on establishing the difference between esports and iGaming, and finally, our efforts have been fulfilled. We welcome this announcement by our government, which will open new avenues to pour in more investment opportunities in this booming industry.   From now onwards, we will have to build proper infrastructure, training facilities and coaching for our young esports athletes. Only a short time until we see esports being placed in the same league as cricket, football, basketball, etc. and having similar fan power, scale and craze,  said Suji.",

We are sure that the online gaming industry will grow responsibly under MeitY\u2019s guidance. The industry is looking forward to working with MeitY in creating a well-balanced regulatory framework,\u201d he added.Responding to a question in Parliament, Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar said earlier this month that the government was aware of the possible risk and challenges of online gaming, including the risk of \u201cviolence abetting video games, addiction to it, and consequential financial loss.\u201dSeparately, the sector has also come under the lens of Indian tax authorities, with the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs having sent notices to around half a dozen online gaming firms based in Malta, the UK and Gibraltar.On Tuesday, ET reported that the government, through the Ministry of Corporate Affairs\u2019 Investor Protection and Education Fund (IPEF), was planning to launch an outreach campaign to create awareness about cryptocurrencies and online gaming.",

Prior to that, the group's headquarters were located in Iran. Hinduja House occupies a nearly half-an-acre prime land parcel next to the National Sports Complex of India and Nehru Science Centre. All expansion plans of the group, both greenfield and brownfield including forays into different sectors, were chalked out from this office,  said one of the persons mentioned above.From the iconic Gulf Oil acquisition in 1984 to its flagship commercial vehicle manufacturing company Ashok Leyland in 1987, and all other investment forays thereafter, including the banking operations, were planned here.The new headquarters will be developed with sustainable and green building features to integrate energy efficiency and water conservation in its design. The existing building will be demolished in the next few weeks, particularly after the Pitru Paksha.The company is in the process of appointing a leading architect and design firm to prepare the redevelopment plan, which will likely feature agile workspaces with each floor designed with a specific theme.The redevelopment of the current structure is being mooted to accommodate the group's expansion plan. In addition to the existing businesses, the new headquarters will house all the offices of the group companies that are currently spread across Mumbai such as renewables, power and cyber security.The offices that are operating out of the current property will be shifted to Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) business district until the redevelopment is complete. The group has already started the shifting process for several departments.ET's email query to the Hinduja Group remained unanswered until the time of going to press.The group's flagship real estate investment and development arm, Hinduja Realty Ventures, recently picked up office properties spread over three floors in Tata Communication's commercial tower in BKC through a lease of over five years.As part of the deal, Hinduja Realty Ventures has also got exclusive access to a total 27 car parking slots in the BKC commercial tower along with the office space in one of the wings of the complex.Hinduja Group has business interests across mobility, lubricants and specialty chemicals, banking and finance, digital technology, healthcare, infrastructure project development, media & entertainment, power and real estate.The group started business in 1914 in Sindh (which is now a province of Pakistan), while it entered the international arena in 1919 with an office in Iran, which was its first outside India.",

        "description": "The Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) awards, considered the top award for scientific research in India, are set to undergo a revamp. The Centre plans to change the award guidelines, format, and nomination system, similar to the Padma Awards. The revamp will likely introduce new categories and increase the number of awardees. ",
        "datePublished": "2023-09-12T23:41:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "The announcement of the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) awardees 2022 this week- delayed by a year- also probably marks the last of this version of the country's top award for scientific research.ET has gathered reliably that the Centre is set to change all the award guidelines, format and nomination system for the SSB awards before the next cycle. The SSB revamp will be re-aligned much like the 'Padma Awards' to bring in a new format for the awards from 2024 onwards, sources said.Since the 2023 SSB award process has not been initiated so far, it is likely that the new award cycle will miss one year and begin from 2024, government insiders indicated to ET.The eponymous award - often termed as the Nobel Prize for Science in India - is expected to retain the name of Dr Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar, Founder Director of the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) credited with setting up the framework for India S&T infrastructure and policies. Currently, the SSB award is given across seven categories - Biological Sciences, Chemical Sciences, Earth, Atmosphere, Ocean and Planetary Sciences, Engineering Sciences, Mathematical Sciences and Physical Sciences. Typically, 12-14 SSB awards are announced every year.The revamp is expected to add several new categories from technology to innovation, AI and so on to bring in new areas and disciplines that have come up over the years. It is also expected that the number of awardees and awards will be increased, ET has learnt.The award nomination system for the SSB - largely controlled by the CSIR so far - is expected to be changed to a  national  one and one that is  department agnostic .The SSB award revamp is part of the larger  transformation  of awards ecosystem, across ministries, being attempted by the Centre. The science awards, including the recast SSB are also expected to be onboarded to the National Awards Portal which is now hosting several awards that have been revamped.Worry areaThere is also considerable discomfort among many in the scientific community about the shake-up of  award ecosystem  being attempted by the Centre.A September 17, 2022, meeting chaired by the Union home secretary indicated over 800 awards from the science and research ministries and departments may be pruned down to six. A new highest science award- Vigyan Ratan- is also envisaged as part of the plan.Many in the scientific community have also expressed apprehensions that the \u201ctransformation\u201d exercise may end up bringing greater governmental control and influence in the scientific R&D ecosystem and end up \u201cdownsizing\u201d science awards.Others feel that the pruning will end up cutting down the institution level awards that helped encourage and retain young talent.That the SSB 2022 awards were not announced on September 26, 2022 - CSIR Foundation Day - as has been the tradition so far, also led to many a raised eyebrow.Further, the SSB awards for 2019, 2020, 2021 were not conferred in a proper ceremony as is usually done but were, instead, sent by post to awardees, citing the pandemic.The last ceremony for SSB awards was, in fact, held in February 2019 and was addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Transformation of Awards EcosystemGovernment insiders, however, claim that the revamp is only aimed at enhancing the stature of the awards, bringing in clear transparent nomination guidelines and decision making. They also assure that the awards, once revamped, will come with more categories, number of awardees and even greater stature.A concept note on transformation of awards - shared with all ministries earlier - said that there are multiple awards across ministries and sometimes \u201cquestions are raised on the selection process\u201d due to lack of public awareness about the procedure followed.It also emphasised the need for simplification of the entire process of nomination through a common single platform to ensure greater public participation and an objective, transparent and merit-based selection criteria and evaluation matrix.The national awards portal is already functioning. Apart from the Padma Awards, a range of awards by other ministries are now on the portal.The most recent was the National Teachers\u2019 Day awards which has joined the portal and opened its doors this year to higher education teachers as well.",

        "articleBody": "Former ISRO Chairman K Kasturirangan has called for creating more departments of aeronautics and aerospace in universities, and facilities in the field in the country to enhance research inputs into India's space programme. Speaking to PTI here, he also indicated that he expects investment into the space sector to go up by two to three times from the present level as the Government is keen to support this field.  We need to make sure that we have a good education system which produces the best aeronautics and aerospace people. So, more universities need to create that department and facilities. If necessary, ISRO should have a special programme to improve the educational component of it,  the veteran space scientist, who was the Chairman of the National Education Policy draft committee, said. Research in universities also needs to be brought up to higher levels so that they can contribute to the space programme. Right now, research inputs into the space programme from universities is very limited, whereas ISRO does support research to some extent with various universities.  Eighty per cent of the students go to universities. So, youngsters are all there, bright minds are there. So, we need to improve that. Research, education and innovation, and industrialisation...these are things which can have much more scope , Kasturirangan, a former member of the now defunct Planning Commission of India, said. Kasturirangan said he is extremely happy that the present government has created institutions such as the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) and NewSpace India Limited (NSIL) whIch have promoted industrialisation, commercialisation and freer international collaboration. These initiatives are already showing their outcome in terms of the number of missions that have increased, and type of income that they are generating, among others, he pointed out over the weekend.  So, this is the direction in which it's going and ISRO is core intellectual organisation, will (continue to) undertake cutting edge technology and science activities; the operational capabilities, service capabilities they will hand it over to some of these institutions and they in turn will create organisation systems or industries which will further take up and also through international collaboration and enhance the activities and financial viability,  he said. Asked if funding needs to go up for the space programmes, Kasturirangan, a former member of the Rajya Sabha, said he has seen this government's general disposition towards programmes which are fructifying in the country and doing well.  And the Prime Minister, I know, is very keen that space sector should be supported at all costs, and we have to be right at the top in terms of the countries which are now pioneers in space. Therefore, I don't think the government will be found wanting in terms of support , he said.  Currently, it's between USD two and three billion dollars per year is the kind of investment that we are making (in the space sector). I am sure that we can easily go up by two to three times which is a very large type of money for the type of work we can do because of all sorts of cost-effectiveness and so on,  he said.  So, I don't think this government will starve the organisation of the funds. They have a determination to make sure that India is right at the top and work with countries which are in the forefront of space programmes in the 21st century and be a partner in major ventures on space along with other countries in the world which have similar capabilities, and resources with which we can join up. So, this is something which is a model which is slowly developing. So, I am not worried that we will be found wanting in terms of this,  Kasturirangan added.",

        "datePublished": "2023-09-12T14:45:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "BENGALURU: Scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) have developed a new approach to potentially detect and kill cancer cells, especially those which form a solid tumour mass. They have created hybrid nanoparticles made of gold and copper sulphide, which can kill cancer cells using heat, and enable their detection using sound waves, according to a study published in 'ACS Applied Nano Materials'. Early detection and treatment are key in the battle against cancer, noted the Bengaluru-based IISc in a statement on Monday. Copper sulphide nanoparticles have previously received attention for their application in cancer diagnosis, while gold nanoparticles, which can be chemically modified to target cancer cells, have shown anti-cancer effects. In the current study, the IISc team decided to combine these two into hybrid nanoparticles.  These particles have photothermal, oxidative stress, and photoacoustic properties,  says Jaya Prakash, Assistant Professor at the Department of Instrumentation and Applied Physics (IAP), IISc, and one of the corresponding authors of the paper. PhD students Madhavi Tripathi and Swathi Padmanabhan are co-first authors. When light is shined on these hybrid nanoparticles, they absorb the light and generate heat, which can kill cancer cells. These nanoparticles also produce singlet oxygen atoms that are toxic for the cells, the release pointed out.  We want both these mechanisms to kill the cancer cell,  Jaya Prakash explains. The researchers say the nanoparticles can also help diagnose certain cancers. Existing methods such as standalone CT and MRI scans require trained radiology professionals to decipher the images. The photoacoustic property of the nanoparticles allows them to absorb light and generate ultrasound waves, which can be used to detect cancer cells with high contrast once the particles reach them. The ultrasound waves generated from the particles allow for a more accurate image resolution as sound waves scatter less when they pass through tissues compared to light. Scans created from the generated ultrasound waves can also provide better clarity and can be used to measure the oxygen saturation in the tumour, boosting their detection, it was noted.  You can integrate this with existing systems of detection or treatment,  says Ashok M Raichur, Professor at the Department of Materials Engineering, and another corresponding author. For example, the nanoparticles can be triggered to produce heat by shining a light on them using an endoscope that is typically used for cancer screening. Previously developed nanoparticles have limited applications because of their large size. The IISc team used a novel reduction method to deposit tiny seeds of gold onto the copper sulphide surface. The resulting hybrid nanoparticles - less than 8 nm in size - can potentially travel inside tissues easily and reach tumours. The researchers believe that the nanoparticles' small size would also allow them to leave the human body naturally without accumulating, although extensive studies have to be carried out to determine if they are safe to use inside the human body. In the current study, the researchers have tested their nanoparticles on lung cancer and cervical cancer cell lines in the lab. They now plan to take the results forward for clinical development.",

        "articleBody": "E-commerce giant Amazon.com is making its first investment in direct air capture technology, which removes emissions from the atmosphere, by committing to purchase 250,000 tons of removal credits over 10 years, it said on Tuesday. Amazon will purchase the credits from the 1PointFive direct air capture (DAC) plant in Texas, which is being developed by oil company Occidental's Oxy Low Carbon Ventures subsidiary and will use them to help meet its climate target of net zero carbon emissions by 2040. The company did not reveal any financial details of the deal, but developers of DAC technology have said removal credits currently cost in the mid-to-high-triple digits in dollars per metric ton. Many scientists believe extracting billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere annually, by using nature or technology, is the only way to meet goals set under the U.N. Paris climate agreement to curb climate change because so many emissions are still being generated by the use of fossil fuels. Projects that suck carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the air can generate removal credits that can then be bought and used by companies to help offset emissions they are unable to cut from their business. Although the technological solutions are still far from proven at a cost and scale that could allow a global roll-out, tech giants have increasingly backed DAC. Microsoft last week signed a multi-year deal for the purchase of 315,000 metric tons with U.S. project developer Heirloom. Amazon's carbon footprint for 2022 was 71.27 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, including Scope 3 emissions which are those generated indirectly from sources the company does not control or own, such as the emissions generated by staff flying for work. Jamey Mulligan, head of carbon neutralization science and strategy at Amazon said an  all hands on deck approach  was needed to scale up the technology.  We have to have massive scale very quickly, 1PointFive and Occidental have significant knowledge, expertise and workforce and experience that's needed to scale industrial plants like this,  he said. Some green groups have criticised the role of oil companies in developing plants to remove carbon dioxide. The 1PointFive project was one of two large-scale DAC  hubs  last month selected for the largest U.S. Department of Energy grants available for the technology. Mulligan said Amazon is focused on cutting its own emissions and scaling up use of renewable energy but will also likely use a portfolio of carbon offsets, including those from nature-based projects, to help reach its net zero target.",

Panchanathan travelled to India at the end of August, making stops in three cities: New Delhi, Bengaluru and Gandhinagar.  In New Delhi, he announced a new funding opportunity between NSF and the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and signed a bilateral implementation arrangement with the Indian Department of Biotechnology (DBT).  He also participated in an industry roundtable organised by the US Embassy.  In Bengaluru, he participated in a biotechnology roundtable organised by DBT and in Gandhinagar, his last stop, Panchanathan led the US delegation at the G20 Chief Science Advisers' Roundtable, a media release said.   In the last five years, NSF has invested nearly USD 150 million in India through over 200 projects. Just this last year, we launched 35 new joint projects with India's Department of Science & Technology in emerging technologies,  Panchanathan was quoted as saying by the NSF on his return from India.   This joint funding opportunity strengthens the foundation of cooperation, collaboration, and joint investment in science and engineering by unlocking fantastic new discoveries, innovations and opportunities across industries like semiconductor research, next generation communication systems, cyber-security, sustainability and green technologies, and intelligent transportation systems,  said Panchanathan.  According to NSF, the new agreement with MeitY provides fresh funding for joint projects in applied research areas and builds on an Implementation Arrangement signed by Panchanathan and MeitY Secretary Alkesh Kumar Sharma, at NSF headquarters in May.  It also advances the mutual interests of India and the US, outlined in a joint statement made by President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June, during the latter's visit to the US which included a stop at NSF's headquarters, the media release said.  On August 22, Panchanathan signed an Implementation Arrangement during a ceremony alongside many notable people, including US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti, India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu, Secretary for DBT and the Department of Science & Technology Rajesh S Gokhale, and Minister of State for Science & Technology Jitendra Singh.   This is a historic moment for India and the US,  said Panchanathan. This implementation arrangement provides a framework to encourage collaborations between research communities and sets out the principles that will help make joint activities successful and productive, he added.  It has potential to tackle, societies' most pressing challenges, spur economic growth, and advance technologies and innovations in critical research areas like systems and synthetic biology, protein design, cellular and biochemical engineering, and circular bioeconomy engineering, among others, he said.  NSF said Panchanathan's trip to India reaffirmed both nations' commitment to shared values and aspirations and illustrated the director's belief that teamwork on a global scale among like-minded players powers scalable opportunities, supercharged progress and universal prosperity - a notion which implicitly endorses India's G20 presidency theme:  Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,  or  One Earth, One Family, One Future.

        "articleBody": "India is becoming a force to be reckoned with in space technology and other countries are now keen to join hands with the country following the success of the Chandrayaan-3 mission, senior scientists said on Thursday. The successful Chandrayaan-3 mission put India in the elite club of nations that have soft landed on lunar surface. India has also become the first country to land on the southern pole of the Moon.  Earlier the number of people congratulating ISRO on its missions was very few. Nowadays, there are copious (congratulatory messages) and abundant appreciation because we are becoming a power now,  Dr P V Venkitakrishnan, ISRO Director (retired) and Materials and Rocket manufacturing expert told PTI. Armed with the success of Chandrayaan-3 mission, ISRO is lining up a series of missions like the Mangalyaan-2 Mars Orbiter Mission, Gaganyaan Human Spaceflight programme and also the Sun mission Aditya-L1.  (Yesterday's successful event) is a definite boost to energise anybody who is working in ISRO or who wants to join ISRO in future,  he said to a query.  This (success of Chandrayaan-3 mission) is a shot in the arm for us and similar missions are coming up. We have to travel more to reach for the Aditya-L1 mission. Similarly inter-planetary missions are coming, Chandrayaan-4 also I think may happen,  he said. According to ISRO Chairman S Somanath, the Aditya-L1 mission is expected to launch next month from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. The rocket will be integrated with the launch complex in a day or two, he had said at the Mission Operations Complex at ISTRAC, Bengaluru soon after the success of the Chandrayaan 3 mission, on Wednesday.  It (success of Chandrayaan-3 mission) gives confidence to configure missions to not only go to the Moon, but also to go to Mars, sometimes (perhaps) land on Mars, maybe in future go to Venus and other planets,  he had said. Venkitakrishnan said,  India and China are also becoming equal powers and nobody will ally with them (China) because of their nature.  He said that other countries are collaborating and allying with India now  because of space only .  We are becoming a super power now. And it is really going to help us in all the missions in the future in a very big way with increased dedication and enthusiasm.  he said. Dr T V Venkateswaran, Scientist at Vigyan Prasar, GOI Department of Science and Technology, in a brief interaction with PTI spoke about what Chandrayaan-3's success means for collaborations between academia and the Indian space industry  Technology and software instruments were designed, developed, conceived and executed by ISRO and Indian academia together in the past.  Many institutions of higher learning were also closely collaborating with ISRO, which goes to show that if industry and academia in India can come together, a lot of very interesting work can also be done in space technology, he added.  The mainstay of ISRO is to provide societal applications with space technology and that is what they concentrate upon. However, being a big country with more than a billion population and a long heritage of science and technology, it is also important that ISRO looks at space science and space research and that is how all these deep space missions are emerging,  he said. The next major mission ISRO is planning to undertake is the Aditya-L1 mission which is to study or put a telescope to observe the Sun, in particular to predict and also identify solar storms and activities of the Sun, he said.  ISRO is doing this project in collaboration with Indian astrophysicists -- the astronomy community -- and that is how the whole instrumentation, satellite and spacecraft is designed and developed,  he added. The success of Chandrayaan-3 will open up more collaborations between ISRO and academia and scientific institutions in the country in realising some of the space science projects, he said. Talking about the Gaganyaan mission, he said,  In 1961, a human reached space with (Soviet Cosmonaut) Yuri Gagarin making a few rounds around the Earth. Since then, a lot of development has taken place in space, and the international space station has been hosting at least three humans continuously from 2020 to 2023. Therefore, space is becoming a new frontier.  India's Gaganyaan mission is also an attempt at sending humans to space. If and when there is an International effort to establish a new space station, India could possibly get a seat at the table thanks to the Gaganyaan effort, he added.",

        "articleBody": "Vikram Sarabhai was succeeded by brilliant and capable leaders, but it was his vision that continued to shape India\u2019s space programme long after his deathIndians looking at the night sky on Wednesday might have felt the moon shone brighter than it ever did before. The silver orb that hangs over us waxing and waning every fortnight acquired a sudden familiarity and a proximity with the successful advance of the Chandrayaan-3 mission. The momentous occasion is the achievement of hundreds of scientists and engineers over many years. But it is also an opportune time to remember the man who started it all and whose name, since 1974, has graced a small, bowlshaped crater (the Sarabhai crater) on the Mare Serenitatis in the north-east quadrant of the Moon.Vikram Sarabhai, founder of the Indian space programme, was born in 1919 in a family of textile barons. Among the world\u2019s wealthiest industrialists, the Sarabhais were unusually political: they were close to Gandhi and allied themselves firmly with the anti-colonial struggle. Surrounded by luxury, spoilt for choice and yet aware of his family legacy of political ac tivism, Vikram chose the path of science.In an era marked by the excitement of new discoveries regarding the atom, Vikram became a physicist. Unlike others who studied cosmic rays for the atomic particles thrown up by them, he came to be interested in cosmic rays as a tool to study outer space. His interest tied in with an emerging trend. In 1961-62, against a background of a global push in space research by the International Council of Scientific Unions, the Department of Atomic Energy (supported by prime minister Nehru and DAE secretary Homi Bhabha) initiated space research in India and set up a sounding rocket programme under Vikram\u2019s leadership.The idea of a poor and newly independent country like India entering a field requiring technology and investment such as space research seemed unimaginably audacious. And the programme was equally so, with Vikram encouraging bright, young scientists and engineers such as Vasant Gowarikar and Abdul Kalam (among many) to join and setting them challenging tasks with threadbare resources on the beaches of Thumba, a fishing village in Kerala. Henri Cartier Bresson captured the slapdash energy of the enterprise in evocative black and white photographs, including an iconic one of two scientists casually transporting a nose cone on a bicycle.The cheekiness was counterbalanced by a highly evolved vision. In 1963, when the Soviets had just about launched the world\u2019s first synchronous satellite, Vikram was already thinking of using satellites for communications. He envisaged applications for space in agriculture, forestry, oceanography, mineral prospecting and cartography. And in a 1966 paper on \u2018Space Activity for Developing Countries\u2019, he hoped that space activity would stimulate growth in electronics and cybernetics and create a new culture of collaboration between countries and specialisations.Vikram\u2019s dream was to link technology with development, serving the needs of the masses while nurturing a highly sophisticated work culture and scientific abilities. One of his favourite phrases was \u2018leapfrog ging\u2019 which referred to his faith in the power of technology to enable developing countries to circumvent the long processes followed by the west. His ideas created a \u2018big sensation internationally\u2019, according to Japanese space scientist Hideo Itokawa, and birthed ambitious schemes such as the world\u2019s first experiment in direct broadcasting by satellite using an American ATS-6 on loan to transmit locally produced content to 2,400 backward Indian villages.Vikram Sarabhai died young, at the age of 52 in December 1971. He was succeeded by brilliant and capable leaders, but he also left behind a vision which continued to shape the programme long after his death.Now that the talented and spirited people of the Indian Space Research Organisation have scaled a new horizon, made us proud and euphoric by taking us to the moon, it is tempting to speculate on how the visionary founder of the space programme might have viewed the potential impact of this achievement.Let me borrow some of his own words as a guide.Here is what he had to say about the effects of science for example: \u201cA person who has imbibed the ways of science injects into a situation a new way of looking at it, hopefully perhaps a degree of enlightenment.\u201d So perhaps this is what he would hope to gain from the moon mission: a broadening of minds, a trigger to innovation, and greater wisdom.Shah is the author of \u2018Vikram Sarabhai: A Life\u2019",

        "articleBody": "WASHINGTON: The United States is seeking a six-month extension to a science and technology agreement with China so that it can undergo negotiations with Beijing to  amend and strengthen  the landmark deal, the State Department said on Wednesday.For over 40 years, the agreement between the two countries has yielded cooperation across a range of scientific and technical fields, a powerful sign that the rivals could set aside their disputes and work together.The deal, signed when Beijing and Washington established diplomatic ties in 1979 and renewed about every five years since, has resulted in cooperation in areas from atmospheric and agricultural science to basic research in physics and chemistry.But concerns about China's growing military prowess and theft of U.S. scientific and commercial achievements have prompted questions about whether the Science and Technology Agreement (STA), set to expire on Aug. 27, should continue. This short-term six-month extension will keep the agreement in force while we seek authority to undertake negotiations to amend and strengthen the terms of the STA. It does not commit the United States to a longer-term extension,  a State Department spokesperson told Reuters.The department said the deal provides consistent standards for government-to-government scientific cooperation, and if it lapsed each agency would have to negotiate individual arrangements with Beijing. We are clear-eyed to the challenges posed by (China's) national strategies on science and technology, Beijing's actions in this space, and the threat they pose to U.S. national security and intellectual property, and are dedicated to protecting the interests of the American people,  the spokesperson said.The chair of the U.S. House of Representatives' select committee on China, Mike Gallagher, and other Republicans have said the deal should be scrapped, citing concerns about industrial espionage, forced technology transfers and other tactics that could fuel China's military modernization.Chinese officials have hoped to extend the deal, and have said publicly they approached the U.S. last year to discuss renewal, but that Washington had been conducting a review of the agreement.China's embassy in Washington did not respond immediately to a request for comment.Proponents of renewing the deal argue that without it, the U.S. would lose valuable insight into China's technical advances. Nonetheless, many analysts say the agreement must be fundamentally reworked to safeguard U.S. innovation in a time of heightened strategic competition with China.",

        "articleBody": "The successful soft landing of India's ambitious Chandrayaan-3 mission on the Moon's enigmatic south pole has captured the attention and admiration of the scientific community. Leading scientists and experts said this monumental accomplishment not only marks India's indelible imprint on lunar exploration but also demonstrates the prowess of human collaboration, determination, and cutting-edge technology.  Dr. Chrisphin Karthick, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bengaluru, expressed his elation.  The successful landing of Chandrayaan-3 is a testament to our collective progress towards space travel. It showcases the beauty of unity in diversity as we sail the cosmic seas together,  he told PTI.   Slow and steady - reaching the goal is better than saying we won the race. I emphasise this since many are comparing it with our friendly nation programmes. It's good to say we earthlings won the race in sailing the universe in many ways,  Karthick added.  The Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 and its objectives are to demonstrate safe and soft-landing on the lunar surface, roving on the Moon, and to conduct in-situ scientific experiments. Chandrayaan-2 had failed in its lunar phase when its lander 'Vikram' crashed into the surface of the Moon following anomalies in the braking system in the lander while attempting a touch down on September 7, 2019. The Chandrayaan programme's maiden mission was in 2008.  Aakash Sinha, Professor of Practice at the Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, Delhi-NCR, and CEO of Omnipresent Robot Tech, hailed ISRO's (Indian Space Research Organisation) feat as a  monumental achievement  that will inspire a new generation of aspiring scientists and explorers.   With this unparalleled accomplishment, India has etched its name in history by becoming the first country to land in this lunar region,  Sinha, who was involved in developing the software for the Pragyan rover of Chandrayaan-3, told PTI.  The lander module comprising the lander (Vikram) and the 26-kg rover (Pragyan) made the soft landing near the south polar region of the Moon at 6.04 pm, less than a week after a similar Russian lander crashed.   ISRO's Chandrayaan mission, which was the pioneer in discovering water on the moon, continues to break barriers and set new standards. Beyond its immediate scientific impact, this mission holds the promise of inspiring a new generation of young minds to join the realms of space exploration and science,  he added.  Sinha highlighted that the mission's accomplishments will  break barriers and set new standards,  positioning India as a frontrunner in lunar research.   Our team worked relentlessly with ISRO to develop the software for the navigation of the Pragyan rover. We are delighted to see our work and research reach the Moon,  he added.  Astrophysicist Sandip Chakraborty noted that the significance of Chandrayaan-3's soft landing cannot be overstated.   Soft landing is a start for future activities, such as science of the Moon and from the Moon. It is a gateway to the outer world,  the director of the Indian Centre for Space Physics, Kolkata, told PTI.  He emphasised that this achievement propels India into an elite group of spacefaring nations, where it can stake its claim to the Moon's scientific and exploratory potential.  India became the fourth country in the world to perform a soft landing on the Moon. Only three countries namely Russia, the US, and China have achieved this remarkable feat.   The successful landing imbibes the confidence in every citizen. Students ambition increases. No future regulation on the Moon can be made without the concurrence of India. So, it would be a paradigm shift event in the Indian context,  Chakraborty added.  Underpinning this success to the remarkable contribution of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered systems developed by ISRO and the Indian academia, scientists believe these systems enabled the craft to navigate the lunar surface with precision, detect hazards, and ultimately achieve a safe landing.  Dr. TV Venkateswaran, a scientist at Vigyaan Prasar, an autonomous organisation under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), and member of the public outreach committee of the Astronomical Society of India, lauded this integration of technology, saying that it will inspire young minds and bolster scientific curiosity.   The safe and soft landing shows that the AI-powered algorithms have worked well. The same algorithms can be tweaked and used to control other autonomous vehicles,  Venkateswaran told PTI.   The success will give a boost to the morale of ISRO and also scientists across the country. Further, it will pave the way for the consistent study of the Moon and the international community. The same technology will also help ISRO land on Mars in a future mission,  he added.  The experts also concur that this success is not an endpoint but a stepping stone toward further exploration.   No future regulation on the Moon can be made without the concurrence of India,  Chakraborty emphasised, hinting at the country's newfound influence in shaping lunar exploration policies.  He said the successful landing of Chandrayaan-3 resonates as a clarion call for aspiring scientists, space enthusiasts, and the global community at large.  Venkateswaran said the common public may enjoy the fruits of science and technology or have a modicum of exposure to the school's general science curriculum. However, they hardly get an opportunity to experience science in its making.   The massive coverage and enthusiasm generated by the media outreach allow the common public to share science in the making. The incredible excitement naturally attracts the young towards science and technology,  he added.",

The Moon is estimated to be about 4.5 billion years old, formed from a collision between a Mars-sized celestial body and Earth. Objects on the Moon weigh significantly less due to its weaker gravitational pull, approximately one-sixth of Earth's. ",
        "datePublished": "2023-08-22T15:03:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "As anticipation grows for India's planned Chandrayaan-3 lunar landing on Wednesday, an expert delves into the fascinating world of Moon exploration. The Moon has captivated human curiosity for centuries, and with each new mission, we uncover more about its geological history, composition and potential for scientific discovery.  Dr. TV Venkateswaran, a scientist at Vigyan Prasar, an autonomous organisation under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), and member of the public outreach committee of the Astronomical Society of India, answers key questions about the Moon's geological evolution, the significance of its south pole, the presence of water and ice, and India's ambitious plans for lunar exploration.  1. What is Moon's geological history and evolution? In other words, how old it is, and when/how did it form? The Moon is estimated to be about 4.5 billion years old, roughly the same age as the Earth. The leading theory about the Moon's formation suggests that a Mars-sized celestial body collided with the young Earth, and the debris from this collision eventually coalesced to form the lunar body. However, current geological evidence from Moon suggests that it may be younger by just 60 million years compared to Earth.  2. How much do things weigh on the Moon, relative to Earth, and why? The Moon's gravitational pull is much weaker than Earth's, approximately one-sixth of Earth's gravity. As a result, objects on the Moon weigh significantly less than they do on Earth. This is due to the Moon's smaller size and mass. For example, a person weighing 68 kilograms on the Earth would weigh only over 11 kg on the Moon.  3. Why do Indian scientists want to land on Moon's south pole? The lunar south pole has become a focal point for exploration due to its unique features and potential scientific value. It is believed to host a vast reservoir of water ice in permanently shadowed regions. The presence of water is of immense significance for future space exploration, as it can be converted into resources such as drinking water, oxygen and and hydrogen for rocket fuel. Also, the permanently sunlit area in the region has a temperature of around minus 50 to 10 degrees Celsius, which provide better chemical condition for the electronics onboard the rover and lander to work properly.  4. What is in the lunar south pole? Is the terrain and geology there the same as elsewhere on the Moon or do we have no idea? The terrain and geology at the Moon's south pole are distinct from other regions. Permanently shadowed craters provide extremely cold conditions that allow water ice to accumulate and persist. The unique geography of the south pole also creates regions of perpetual sunlight, which can be harnessed for solar power. The terrain varies from rugged landscapes to relatively flat plains, offering a diverse range of scientific opportunities.  5. Why is a region of the lunar south pole permanently shadowed? This depends on the Moon's geology. The Moon's axis is only slightly tilted relative to its orbit around the Earth. This results in certain areas near the poles being in permanent shadow. These shadows create extremely cold environments where temperatures can plummet to very low levels. These frigid conditions are conducive to preserving water ice for billions of years.  6. Does water/ice exist on the lunar south pole? Chandrayaan-1 seemed to have suggested it. Yes, water ice has been confirmed to exist in the Moon's south pole region. Data from various lunar missions, including India's Chandrayaan 1, launched in 2008, have indicated the presence of water molecules in these permanently shadowed regions. This discovery has opened up exciting possibilities for sustained lunar exploration.  7. Is water/ice critical for future lunar exploration? Water ice is a critical resource for future lunar exploration and even beyond. It can be converted into breathable air, drinking water, and most importantly, hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel. This could revolutionise space travel by reducing the need to transport these resources from Earth, making long-duration missions more feasible.  8. Does India plan to send a manned mission to the Moon in the future? While ISRO has expressed its intention to send astronauts to space as part of its Gaganyaan mission, there are no plans yet to send human missions to the Moon in the near future.102907493",

        "description": "The Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) awards, considered the top award for scientific research in India, are set to undergo a revamp. The Centre plans to change the award guidelines, format, and nomination system, similar to the Padma Awards. The revamp will likely introduce new categories and increase the number of awardees. ",
        "datePublished": "2023-09-12T23:41:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "The announcement of the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) awardees 2022 this week- delayed by a year- also probably marks the last of this version of the country's top award for scientific research.ET has gathered reliably that the Centre is set to change all the award guidelines, format and nomination system for the SSB awards before the next cycle. The SSB revamp will be re-aligned much like the 'Padma Awards' to bring in a new format for the awards from 2024 onwards, sources said.Since the 2023 SSB award process has not been initiated so far, it is likely that the new award cycle will miss one year and begin from 2024, government insiders indicated to ET.The eponymous award - often termed as the Nobel Prize for Science in India - is expected to retain the name of Dr Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar, Founder Director of the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) credited with setting up the framework for India S&T infrastructure and policies. Currently, the SSB award is given across seven categories - Biological Sciences, Chemical Sciences, Earth, Atmosphere, Ocean and Planetary Sciences, Engineering Sciences, Mathematical Sciences and Physical Sciences. Typically, 12-14 SSB awards are announced every year.The revamp is expected to add several new categories from technology to innovation, AI and so on to bring in new areas and disciplines that have come up over the years. It is also expected that the number of awardees and awards will be increased, ET has learnt.The award nomination system for the SSB - largely controlled by the CSIR so far - is expected to be changed to a  national  one and one that is  department agnostic .The SSB award revamp is part of the larger  transformation  of awards ecosystem, across ministries, being attempted by the Centre. The science awards, including the recast SSB are also expected to be onboarded to the National Awards Portal which is now hosting several awards that have been revamped.Worry areaThere is also considerable discomfort among many in the scientific community about the shake-up of  award ecosystem  being attempted by the Centre.A September 17, 2022, meeting chaired by the Union home secretary indicated over 800 awards from the science and research ministries and departments may be pruned down to six. A new highest science award- Vigyan Ratan- is also envisaged as part of the plan.Many in the scientific community have also expressed apprehensions that the \u201ctransformation\u201d exercise may end up bringing greater governmental control and influence in the scientific R&D ecosystem and end up \u201cdownsizing\u201d science awards.Others feel that the pruning will end up cutting down the institution level awards that helped encourage and retain young talent.That the SSB 2022 awards were not announced on September 26, 2022 - CSIR Foundation Day - as has been the tradition so far, also led to many a raised eyebrow.Further, the SSB awards for 2019, 2020, 2021 were not conferred in a proper ceremony as is usually done but were, instead, sent by post to awardees, citing the pandemic.The last ceremony for SSB awards was, in fact, held in February 2019 and was addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Transformation of Awards EcosystemGovernment insiders, however, claim that the revamp is only aimed at enhancing the stature of the awards, bringing in clear transparent nomination guidelines and decision making. They also assure that the awards, once revamped, will come with more categories, number of awardees and even greater stature.A concept note on transformation of awards - shared with all ministries earlier - said that there are multiple awards across ministries and sometimes \u201cquestions are raised on the selection process\u201d due to lack of public awareness about the procedure followed.It also emphasised the need for simplification of the entire process of nomination through a common single platform to ensure greater public participation and an objective, transparent and merit-based selection criteria and evaluation matrix.The national awards portal is already functioning. Apart from the Padma Awards, a range of awards by other ministries are now on the portal.The most recent was the National Teachers\u2019 Day awards which has joined the portal and opened its doors this year to higher education teachers as well.",

        "description": "India's Rural Development Ministry has created a policy for using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to monitor work under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGS programme. Drones may be used for monitoring work, assessing the impact of work, and inspecting completed work, as well as assisting Ombudspersons. ",

        "articleBody": "In line with Centre's push for use of unmanned aerial vehicles in rural areas, especially in agriculture, the Rural Development Ministry has formulated a new policy for use of drones to monitor works under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. Drones will be used for monitoring ongoing work, inspection of completed work, and impact assessment. It can also be used by Ombudspersons appointed in each district to address grievances.  The expenditure towards using drones may be made under the Admin contingency component of the MNREGS, which is around 10 per cent of the fund allocated to the state.  No additional allocations have been made towards it and states have been directed to hire agencies specialising in using drone technology.   To leverage the use of drones, it has been proposed to use this technology for monitoring and inspection of works and quality of assets under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS,  the circular with the standard operating procedures said.  Drones will be used for monitoring works underway by capturing geo-referenced images before the start, during execution, and after the completion of the work.  Drones will also be used for gathering time series data for impact assessment of natural resource management, water and agriculture-related works done under the scheme.  Special inspections will also be carried out using drones, for enquiring complaints against the work or asset created, the circular said.  It will help Ombudspersons who are appointed in each district to receive grievances. The Ministry said Ombudsperson may also use drones for verification of the works virtually.   This facility will help Ombudsperson to pass awards in a bound manner. Therefore, the state government should provide drone facility to Ombudsperson for timely redress of complaints against a demand by the Ombudsperson,  the ministry said.  The quantum of the monitoring of works using drones may be decided by the states or Union Territories, it said.  The ministry in its SoPs has directed that drones being used should have a high-quality camera.  Users have also been asked to carry out the monitoring through drone in better light condition when the sun is overhead to minimise the shadows in photographs and it is also suggested to avoid partly cloudy days and high winds. The drone should be able to remain airborne for a minimum period of 30 minutes.  All videos and images through drone should be shared with the NREGA Soft.  Data generated over a period of time must be stored for comparison of time series data. The data can be used for systematic and scientific planning and monitoring of the rural area.  Addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 77th Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a pitch for use of science and technology in rural development.  The PM said that 15,000 women's self-help groups would be given loan and training for operating and repairing drones.",

        "description": "The success of India's carbon market will depend on the regulator's ability to enforce design features, according to Rohini Pande, Director of Economic Growth Centre at Yale University. Introducing a bond system like the one piloted at Gujarat Pollution Control Board where penalties are issued for non-compliance could be effective. Carbon market permits will be given to participating companies, and there may be a cap on aggregate carbon emissions. ",
        "datePublished": "2023-08-03T17:35:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "Bengaluru: The success of India's evolving carbon market will depend critically on the choice of design features and the regulator\u2019s ability to enforce them, Rohini Pande, Director of Economic Growth Centre at Yale University told ET. The Henry Heinz II Economics Professor and winner of Infosys Prize 2022 in Social Sciences said the market could be a more effective means to curb carbon emissions than a tax on emissions, drawing on the learnings from her work with Surat's particulate matter pollution market.In Surat\u2019s market, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board was the regulatory authority. \u201cThere is a system where, before the market is launched, participating firms post a hefty bond. If a firm does not hold sufficient permits for its emissions at the end of a compliance period, then the firm is penalised directly from the bond.\u201d she said. A similar policy could be promising in the context of the upcoming carbon market.While the government issued a notification about the carbon market scheme in May this year, the details of implementation are yet to be determined. These features include how the permits will be given to participating companies and whether there will be a cap on aggregate carbon emissions in the market. Earlier this week, Pande presented a lecture at the Infosys Science Foundation in Bengaluru on the past, present and future of India\u2019s emissions market. Under a cap and trade market system, like the one used in Surat\u2019s particulate matter pollution market, Pande explained, the governing body establishes a total \u201ccap\u201d (limit) of the emissions it is going to allow. In Surat, this cap was in terms of particulate matter. In a carbon market this is typically in terms of aggregate carbon emissions. Companies would be given, or sold, a certain number of permits, corresponding to the amount of carbon they are allowed to emit. They can sell the permits they don\u2019t need in the market. This means that companies that can reduce carbon emissions cheaply can sell permits to those which would find it more expensive to reduce emissions, or which need to emit more - thus incentivising the most cost-efficient adaptation of clean technologies.Under this system, the government would either reduce the cap over time, to reduce overall emissions, or increase the cap slowly to ensure that emissions from economic growth do not exceed negotiated commitments. Government companies can also be part of the system, Pande added.Safeguards, she said, are necessary, especially about speculators entering the market, which could turn it either way. Pande was optimistic however about India benefiting from international climate financing bodies entering the market. \u201cWell-run markets have a higher credibility than the Clean Development Mechanisms (CDMs) under the Kyoto protocol,\u201d she said.Under the protocol, Annex B countries, or countries with emission reduction commitments could earn carbon credits by building emission-reduction projects in developing countries. One of the criticisms of the scheme was that international companies could be rewarded for projects that did not end up reducing emissions to the extent expected. The Indian government plans to introduce a Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) by 2026 to enable the country to reach its goal of reducing emissions intensity of GDP to 45% of 2005 levels by 2030. The target is part of India\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement. Last month, the government announced that it would appoint a National Steering Committee to oversee the market, which will function under both the Ministry of Power and the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change.",

Ramesh said the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi quietly withdrew the Bill from the Lok Sabha on Monday. The Bill was examined in detail by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, which suggested a number of important amendments to ensure that the provisions in it were not misused or abused, the Congress leader said. A few members had submitted notes of dissent as well, he pointed out, adding that the committee's report was submitted on February 3, 2021.  Now the Modi government says most of the provisions of the Bill have already been made part of the Criminal Procedure (Identification) Act, 2022 and hence the DNA Bill is not required.  Actually, the real reason is that the Modi government did NOT want the elaborate safeguards recommended by the Standing Committee and decided to just ignore it after having pressed for early submission of its report,  Ramesh said on Twitter.  The fears of the critics of the government's DNA Bill now stand fully justified,  he added. Ramesh is the chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology. The government withdrew the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019 from the Lok Sabha on Monday. Amid sloganeering by opposition members over the situation in strife-torn Manipur, Union minister Jitendra Singh withdrew the Bill. The Bill, introduced on July 8, 2019, sought to regulate the use and application of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) technology for the purpose of establishing the identity of certain categories of people, including victims, offenders, suspects, undertrials, those missing and unidentified deceased. An official said since most of the provisions of the Bill were broadly covered in the Criminal Procedure (Identification) Act, 2022 brought by the Ministry of Home Affairs, a decision was taken by the government to withdraw it.",

After crisscrossing Europe last month meeting lawmakers and national leaders to discuss the prospects and threats of AI, Altman has travelled to Israel, Jordan, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, India and South Korea - all this week. South Korea is one of few countries that has developed its own foundation models for artificial intelligence in a field dominated by the United States and China, thanks to local tech firms such as Naver, Kakao, and LG.  The firms are seeking ways to tap niche or specialised markets that have not yet been addressed by big tech in U.S. or China.  Naver said it has been keen to develop localised AI applications for countries with political sensitivities in the Middle East as well as for non-English speaking countries, such as Spain and Mexico, the Financial Times reported in May, citing a Naver executive. The rapid development and popularity of generative AI since Microsoft Corp-backed OpenAI launched ChatGPT last year is spurring lawmakers globally to formulate laws to address safety concerns linked to the technology.  The European Union is moving ahead with its draft AI Act, which is expected to become law later this year, while the United States is leaning toward adapting existing laws for AI rather than creating whole new legislation. South Korea has new AI regulation awaiting full parliament approval, which is seen as less restrictive than the EU's version.  In February, a parliament committee passed an AI law draft that guarantees freedom to release AI products and services, and will only restrict them if regulators deem any product to be harming the lives, safety, and rights of people. South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT announced in April plans focused on fostering local AI development, such as measures to provide datasets for training hyperscale AI, while continuing discussions in AI ethics and regulations.",

Similar to space exploration, we need to go deeper into the ocean and do research. We must be prepared to go much deeper and make India proud... Life in the ocean and life on the land are directly connected,  Rijiju said at the event and called upon people to rededicate themselves on World Ocean Day to contribute in a much better way to humanity.  We must build our future more secure and enrich ourselves with better knowledge systems, live with dignity and respect nature. God has been kind to us. Whatever has been gifted to us through nature must be preserved,  the minister said. Rijiju, who earlier in the day launched a coastal cleaning drive at Besant Nagar here.He said the initiative would send out a strong positive message that the government is concerned about the lives on land as well as the ocean. He called upon the NIOT scientists to showcase their research outcomes, as these are basically meant to benefit the people.  Success stories should be told to people in a better and candid manner,  he added. He regretted that the blue economy's contribution to the national GDP is less than 10 percent.  We are underperforming. Smaller countries with shorter coastlines have larger contributions to their national economy. This means India will have to ensure that oceans do not remain as a vast potent canvas but utilise the resources in the best possible manner,  he said. Secretary of Ministry of Earth Sciences M Ravichandran, Director of NIOT G A Ramadoss, Rear Admiral of Indian Navy Ravi Kumar Dhingra, NSS volunteers as well as representatives of the Norwegian Embassy along with the public participated in the beach cleaning drive.",

        "articleBody": "Chinese organisations launched 79 large-language models (LLMs) in the country over the past three years as they doubled down on efforts to develop artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, a report by state-run research institutes said. The development of LLMs, trained using deep learning techniques on massive amounts of text data, entered an  accelerated  phase in 2020, as per the report authored by research institutes run by the country's Ministry of Science and Technology. In 2020, Chinese organisations released 2 LLMs, compared with 11 in the United States, but in 2021 there was a total of 30 LLMs released in each country, said the report published on Sunday. U.S. organisations in total released 37 LLMs the following year, to China's 28, according to figures compiled in the report, whose co-authors include the Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of China. So far this year, China is in the lead with 19 LLMs to U.S.' 18.  Judging from the distribution of large-language models released around the world, China and the United States lead by a big margin, accounting for more than 80% of the global total,  the report concluded, according to a press release that summarised the report's main findings.  The United States has always ranked first in the world in terms of the number of large-language models.  The report comes when the country's AI industry faces significant challenges as U.S.-led export controls restrict Chinese organisations from accessing semiconductors used to train LLMs, among other advanced computing tasks. The report analysed the 79 LLMs developed in China, noting that while there were already 14 provinces and regions where such technology was developed, joint development projects between academia and industry were  insufficient.  After OpenAI released ChatGPT, Chinese tech giants, from Alibaba to surveillance firm Sensetime and search engine giant Baidu, have launched their own versions of chatbots powered by generative AI and LLMs.",

        "articleBody": "Highlighting the country's strides in the pharma and biotechnology sector, Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Sunday said the Indian vaccine market is expected to reach a valuation of Rs 252 billion by 2025. Singh, who is leading a high-level official Indian delegation of the Ministry of Science and Technology on a 6-day visit to the United Kingdom, visited the 175-year-old London Science Museum on Sunday. He spoke about setting up similar science museums in India by the government. The Minister said that the idea of setting up these museums is to help enable the common citizens particularly the youngsters to realise their hidden potential and sometimes even discover their inherent aptitudes of which they themselves may not be aware of. It also ignites curiosity in them which then may help sharpen their scientific temper and inspire creative innovation.The Science Museum is a major museum on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, London. It was founded in 1857. The Minister was taken around the exclusive pavilion set up to trace the history of the Covid pandemic right from the first case that appeared to the first person who got vaccinated. The history has been recorded in chronological order for the awareness and education of people. India's lead role in the management and prevention of Covid has shown to be recognised in the pavilion.Singh said that India is fast emerging as the world's major bio-economy and over the last few years, it has grown by leaps and bounds regarding innovation and technology. He pointed out that India has developed four indigenous vaccines in just two years.The Minister added that the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) in the Ministry of Science and Technology has through  Mission COVID Suraksha , delivered four vaccines, augmented the manufacturing of Covaxin, and created the necessary infrastructure for the smooth development of future vaccines so that the country is pandemic ready.Singh said that the world is now increasingly realising India's superlative capacities in preventive healthcare and we are now in the process of developing several other vaccines in the series. Recently after the first DNA vaccine, the first nasal vaccine has also been successfully manufactured and another vaccine related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) which has helped in the prevention of cervical cancer has also been developed.The Minister underlined that the Indian vaccine market, which has carved out a place for itself at the global level, is expected to reach a valuation of Rs 252 billion by 2025.He also called for extended collaboration in biotech startups and vaccine development between India and the United Kingdom.

There is a lot in common between India and the UK and the year 2023 is a very exciting year for India when we are hosting G20 and we look forward to the UK joining the July meeting, which is dedicated to science, technology and innovation,  said Dr Singh. Following his meeting with UK Science Minister George Freeman within the UK Parliament complex in London, he signed the joint MoU on research between the two countries which the UK government said would enable quicker and deeper collaboration on science between the two science powerhouses that will drive economic growth, create skilled jobs and improve lives in the UK, India, and worldwide. The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said the agreement will  remove red tape  standing in the way of major collaborations, while unleashing a raft of new joint research schemes aiming to deliver progress on some of the biggest issues facing the world, from climate change and pandemic preparedness through to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.  India is rapidly building on its phenomenal software and innovation sectors to become a global powerhouse in science and technology. With our extensive trading and cultural links, shared democratic values and interest in urgent global issues from green technology and agri-tech to biosecurity and pandemic preparedness, we have very strong platforms for deepening research collaboration,  said Freeman.  Today's agreement is part of our program of deepening UK collaboration with other global science superpowers on ground-breaking innovation and research, to help tackle shared global challenges. This partnership will grow the sectors, companies and jobs of tomorrow for the benefit of both our countries and the globe,  he added. Besides, his ministry announced that India will be named a partner for the UK's International Science Partnerships Fund, carrying forward the UK-India science partnership built through the Newton-Bhabha fund. The renewed partnership will kick off with two new joint UK-India research programmes: GBP 5 million UK funding, matched by India, for research into Farmed Animal Diseases and Health and GBP 3.3 million UK funding, matched by India, towards a technology and skills partnership programme that will enable UK and Indian researcher to develop skills, technologies and knowledge in areas such as AI, machine learning and bio-imaging. Other bilateral agreements to be struck at the Science and Innovation Council meeting on Wednesday include: Several UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and Indian Department for Science and Technology (DST) joint research calls, including programmes on sustainability and solid earth hazards; an intention to launch a partnership for decarbonising India's pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries; a programme of UK-India university partnerships, including one between Aston University and CSIR Dehradun on sustainable biofuels; and the fourth annual meeting of the RS/INSA Yusuf Hamied programme, a scheme designed to promote relationships and knowledge exchanges between UK and Indian researchers. The UK government said the collaborative activities carried out under the MoU will be supported by joint funding agreed by both sides, with finances for each programme determined on a case-by-case basis.",

        "articleBody": "The government should consider launching a 'PLI Plus' scheme with focus on development of new products, industrial designs and enhancing productivity with a view to boost domestic manufacturing, economic think tank GTRI said on Sunday. A production-linked incentives scheme (PLI) is under implementation by the government with a budgetary outlay of about Rs 2 lakh crore for 14 sectors such as white goods, mobile, telecommunication and auto components.  The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) report said that creating sustainable and competitive manufacturing is imperative to increase the share of manufacturing in GDP to 25 per cent by 2030, up from 15 per cent at present.   This will require shifting focus to one step back. From quick manufacturing outcomes to R&D, reverse engineering, and deep work.   This can be done under the Make in India framework with the launch of eight PLI Plus initiatives. These initiatives will strengthen the foundation of Indian manufacturing and aspire to bring the expertise level at par with developed countries like Germany, the US, Japan etc,  GTRI co-founder Ajay Srivastava said.  Under the initiative, he called for focus on laying the foundation for new product development; enhancing productivity of entire product sectors; supporting industrial design, development and manufacturing to cut imports; and boost ease of doing business measures.  For the initiative, he suggested the government use Rs 1 lakh crore from the existing funds.  Creation of global quality basic science research set up; inviting more Suzuki, GE and Apple type of firms in india; developing end-to-end product ecosystems; supporting manufacturing of products made by small and medium-size firms; and localising production of fertilizer and plastics will help India strengthen foundation of its manufacturing and aspire to bring the expertise level at par with developed countries, it added.   India must develop expertise in basic sciences, chemistry, metals, electronics, etc. These require long-term and sustained investment and collaborations with institutions across the world. Most such expertise is available only with firms located in Germany, Japan, and the US,  it said.  India imported machinery of value USD 54 billion in 2022 and therefore India needs to reverse engineer these to enable local, high-quality manufacturing, it said, adding a beginning may be made by reverse-engineering products such as machinery for textiles sector, mining, and agriculture.   India imported fertilizers worth USD 17 billion and plastics products of value USD 27 billion in 2022. Technology for making these products is at least five decades old, and India has abundant raw materials. We must explore if most imports of fertilizer and plastics serve the interests of the trading lobby,  the report said.  Further, it suggested that the Ministry of MSME and the Department of Science and Technology devise an intensive program to identify high-potential existing manufacturers and handhold them to upgrade.   A beginning may be made with the following products. These are imported in large quantities,  it said.  The GTRI further said that most electronic products are made with lakhs of components and India must focus on developing this sector for sustainable advantage.  Currently, India imports most components.   Our component strategy should concentrate on developing a component hub to facilitate quick imports, setting up manufacturing for low-end components, and allowing credit for duty-free imports to firms,  it said, adding the government should look at setting up component hubs for prompt supply of imported components.  Component hubs will be Bonded Cargo warehouses allowing vendors to import and store components without payment of duty. The hubs will trigger domestic electronic and IT hardware goods ecosystem development, the report said.",

The British-Indian leader said the new Science and Technology Framework is designed to challenge every part of the government to better put the country at the forefront of global science and technology this decade through 10 key actions, creating a coordinated cross-government approach. Downing Street said the framework will work alongside a raft of new measures backed by over \u00a3370 million in funding to boost investment in innovation, bring the world's best talent to the UK, and seize the potential of ground-breaking new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI).  Trailblazing science and innovation have been in our DNA for decades. But in an increasingly competitive world, we can only stay ahead with focus, dynamism and leadership,  said Sunak.  That's why we're setting out 10 key actions under a bold new plan to cement our place as a global science and technology superpower by 2030 - from pursuing transformational technologies like AI and supercomputing to attracting top talent and ensuring they have the tools they need to succeed. The more we innovate, the more we can grow our economy, create the high-paid jobs of the future, protect our security, and improve lives across the country,  he said. The delivery of the new framework is set to begin immediately with an initial set of projects, which are estimated as being worth around \u00a3500 million in new and existing funding towards skills and infrastructure to help the UK take a global lead in  game-changing technologies .  Innovation and technology are our future. They hold the keys to everything from raising productivity and wages, to transforming healthcare, reducing energy prices and ultimately creating jobs and economic growth in the UK, providing the financial firepower allowing us to spend more on public services,  said Michelle Donelan, the new UK science, innovation and technology secretary. She added:  That is why, today, we are putting the full might of the British government and our private sector partners behind our push to become a scientific and technological superpower, because only through being world-leaders in future industries like AI and quantum will we be able to improve the lives of every Briton,  she said. The UK government said its framework has been designed in consultation with industry experts and academics to help deliver stronger growth, better jobs, and bold discoveries. It covers \u00a3250 million investment in three  truly transformational  technologies in AI, quantum technologies and engineering biology to tackle the biggest global challenges like climate change and healthcare. There is also up to \u00a350 million earmarked to spur co-investment in science from the private sector and philanthropists to drive the discoveries of the future and \u00a3117 million of existing funding to create hundreds of new PhDs for AI researchers and \u00a38 million to find the next generation of AI leaders around the world to do their research in the UK. The British government also announced a further extension until June 30 of the financial guarantee provided to the UK's Horizon Europe applicants as part of its scientific collaboration with the EU.",

        "articleBody": "Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Saturday said Pakistan is habitual of making unnecessary noises alleging violations of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), even though there has been none and India has always stood by its end of the pact. The statement of the Minister of State in the Prime Minister's office comes on the heels of India issuing a notice to Pakistan seeking a review and modification of the IWT in view of Islamabad's  intransigence  in complying with the dispute redressal mechanism of the pact that was inked over six decades ago for sharing of waters of cross-border rivers.  The step comes around 10 months after the World Bank announced appointing a neutral expert and a chair of the Court of Arbitration under two separate processes to resolve the differences over the Kishenganga and Ratle Hydro Electric Projects following Islamabad's refusal to address the matter through bilateral talks.   IWT has a long history after it was signed in 1960, giving control of three rivers each to India and Pakistan. While Jhelum, Chenab and Indus were given to Pakistan, India was given the control of Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej.   The first phase of Shahpur Kandi dam project on river Ravi is nearing completion. The project was in limbo for the last 40 years and our share of water was also flowing across the border.   Similarly, the Ratle project in Kishtwar over Chenab was abandoned for eight years and the work on it started only last year under joint venture between the Centre and the UT administration,  Singh told reporters on the sidelines of a function in Kathua district.  He said Pakistan has raised an objection and is claiming violation of the IWT but India's position is strong as there was no violation and the waters are allowed to flow into Pakistan as per the agreement, despite construction of dams and other projects.   They are habitual of creating disturbances without any reason ... The concerned ministry has already taken up the issue with Pakistan,  the minister said, adding the government will do whatever is necessary in the national interest.  Earlier, the minister inaugurated a 'Young Start-Up Conclave' organised by CSIR, Ministry of Science and Technology, and called for a change of attitude of youth towards startups.   The government job mind-set is proving an impediment to startup culture, mainly in north India. The youth of Jammu and Kashmir need not to miss the startup bus, which is playing a crucial role in India's technological and economic journey to emerge as a frontline nation in the world,  he said.  The minister said J&K has a huge unexplored potential for agriculture and tech startups as the geography and climatic conditions here favour the cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants.  The minister said a new wave of agri-tech startups has emerged in the country in the last few years, which are solving problems of supply chain management, cooling and refrigeration, seed management and distribution, and helping farmers access a wider range of markets.   Jammu & Kashmir and several hill territories as well as the Himalayan states are going to make a significant value edition to build India's future economy because these are the territories whose resources have remain under-utilised in the past,  he said.  With Prime Minister Narendra Modi giving a focused attention to these areas, they are going to play a pivotal role in placing India on the world pedestal by 2047, he said.",

        "articleBody": "Several professors of JNU and other institutions have accused a former JNU employee of duping them of crores of rupees promising them homes on a DDA plot under a housing development scheme which was never there. After waiting for over seven years, when these academics did not get anything except hollow promises, their patience ran out and they lodged a formal complaint with the Delhi Police.  Prima facie, police have found incriminating evidence against the accused in the matter and have lodged an FIR.  In 2015, just before he was due retirement, Dr DP Gaikwad, a technical staff in the Department of Environmental Science of JNU, floated a society and named it Noble Socio-Scientific Welfare Organization (NSSWO).  He sold its membership to his peers claiming that the society owned land in the L-Zone in Dwarka Najafgarh Area under the Land Pooling Policy.  He collected from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 16 lakh each from the academic and non-academic staff of JNU, IIT-Delhi, and other nearby institutions for three years in various installments, assuring them that the project was on.   To make it appear real, he took several of us to show a piece of land, but later it turned out that NSSWO was not the owner of the land,  Professor Gobardhan Das, Chairperson, Molecular Medicine, JNU, said.   After collecting a hefty amount by cheating all the members, he stopped communicating and blocked all his phone numbers,  Das, a victim of the scam, said.  After he went incommunicado, he was however traced in Gurugram by some professors who went there to confront him.  All the same, he again reeled them in with the offer of another lucrative scheme.   He continued to play his trick of cheating and in February 2019, he offered to transfer our membership of NSSWO to another entity named Siddhartha Officers Housing and Social Welfare Society (SOHSWS) through which our flats were to be delivered, however, with a significantly escalated cost,  Prof Biswajit Kundu from IIT-Delhi, one of the 10 complainants in the FIR, said.   He didn't give any explanation for doing so, nor did he provide any details of any consequent changes in the agreement.   In spite of repeated requests by several members, he never called a general body meeting of either society, nor took consent from the members of NSSWO for the changes made unilaterally,  Kundu added.  Gaikwad himself admitted that there are 38 professors from JNU who have invested in the project, Das said.   There are two from IIT and many more from other nearby institutions as far as I know. Initially, in a few cases, he returned 50 to 80 per cent money when he was forced to do so, but later he simply refused to return any money,  Das added.  Dr Bindu Dey, a former senior scientist in the Department of Biotechnology in the Ministry of Science and Technology, was another victim of Gaikwad.  Having lost Rs 8 lakh in a bogus scheme, Dey in 2018 filed a complaint against Gaikwad at Vasant Kunj Police Station where an FIR was lodged against him.   He collected Rs 16 lakh from me in the name of offering an affordable home but kept delaying with one excuse or the other. After a lot of persuasion and follow-up, he returned Rs 8 lakh but the remaining amount is still with him,  Dey, who retired from the DBT, said.  These academics are the latest in a huge list of victims of real estate fraud in the L-Zone where the Delhi Development Authority had first announced the Land Pooling Policy around 2014.  Before the policy could take the final shape, many housing schemes were floated and till date thousands of people have been defrauded.  Despite DDA's advisories cautioning people against making any investment in the L-zone in various newspapers, people in need of an affordable home continued to invest and falling prey to frauds.   The DDA amended the policy in 2018 but still there is a whole lot of ambiguity around it. Investing here is a trap for any prospective homebuyer. I advise people to stay away from it,  Amit Jain, a real estate expert, said.",

        "articleBody": "A newly developed air filtering technique that uses ingredients commonly found in green tea can deactivate germs that find refuge inside air filters, the Ministry of Science and Technology said in an official statement. A research team led by Prof Suryasarathi Bose and Prof Kaushik Chatterjee at Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, has developed a germ-destroying air filter that can inactivate germs using ingredients like polyphenols and polycationic polymers commonly found in green tea.  The 'green' ingredients rupture the microbes through site-specific binding, the statement said.  With a prolonged use, air filters become a breeding ground for captured germs. The growth of these germs clog the pores of the filter, reducing their life.  Re-suspension of these germs can infect people in the vicinity, the statement said.  The novel antimicrobial air filters were tested at an NABL accredited laboratory and were found to be 99.24 per cent effective against SARS-CoV-2 (delta variant).  The technology was transferred to AIRTH, a start-up that is replacing the existing germ-growing air filters with these germ-destroying air filters for commercial purposes, the statement said.  The air-filtering technique was granted a patent in 2022.  The deployment of these novel antimicrobial filters in ACs, central ducts, and air purifiers can play a crucial role in fight against air pollution and mitigate the spread of air-borne pathogens such as several coronaviruses, the statement said.",
