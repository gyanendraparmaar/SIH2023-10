On the other hand, the cumulative effect of the G20 Summit has been that of success in showcasing the strength of the country to the world. I am not concerned with the praise in editorials. For me, the real happiness lies in the fact that my country is now confident that it can host any such event in the best possible way,  the prime minister said.He said in this event, Union Ministers and the senior officers were occupying the rear seats while ground-level functionaries were at the forefront.  I like this arrangement as it assures me that my foundation is strong,  Modi said.During the programme, the prime minister asked the functionaries to sit informally and share their experiences in their respective departments. In routine office work one does not come to know the capabilities of their colleagues, he said.This, Modi said, puts one's performance in a broader perspective.  Once we know the efforts of others, that pushes us to do better. Today's programme is about mazdoor ekta zindabad. We all are mazdoor (labourers). Main thoda bada mazdoor hoon, aap thode chhote mazdoor. Hum sab toh mazdoor hain. (I am a bigger mazdoor, you are smaller mazdoors. We all are labourers,  he said.Referring to the elaborate planning and execution process, the prime minister asked the functionaries to document their experiences and learnings. The document, thus prepared, can be useful to form guidelines for future events, he said.The secret of success of such big events are the sense of importance of enterprise and a feeling of being a central part of that enterprise in everyone, Modi said.He also cited India's contribution in rescue and relief efforts during calamities such as the earthquakes in Nepal and Turkiye, cyclone in Fiji and the crises in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.  All this showed India standing strong and reaching everywhere in times of need,  Modi said.The prime minister underlined the need for global exposure in order to improve further and said global approach and context should underline all work.The interaction saw the participation of around 3,000 people, who have contributed to the success of G20 Summit.It especially included those who have worked at the ground level such as cleaners, drivers, waiters and other staffers from various ministries. The interaction was also attended by ministers and officials of various departments. "

Justin Trudeau is speaking his supporter's language. Canada has mortgaged its foreign policy for the sake of political sports land,  said Sunil JakharWelcoming Centre's decision to suspend visa services in Canada, Jakhar said,  If the Trudeau govt will continues to support the separatist forces, the Indian government for the time being keeping careful consideration has suspended visas to develop a system so that India's integrity and sovereignty can be maintained by avoiding these forces entering into India, especially Punjab.  Punjab BJP chief also acknowledged the fact that some people may be facing challenges as their relatives are living in Punjab and said that the integrity of India is more important than the concerns of any individual.  The unity, integrity and brotherhood of the country is more important than the concerns of any individual, whatever is happening is the Canadian government's mistake. Justin Treadu has given a statement without facts or an official record. As they sow seeds, so reap the fruits. Pakistan got hit by inter-gang rivalry and its economy got ruined, Canada is also following the same path.  He said that despite the fact that the Financial Action Task Force sent a notice to Nijjar, the Canadian government provided a safe haven for Nijjar.He lauded the Indian government's foriegn policy and said that we have differences of opinion in domestic policy, but when it comes to foreign policy, we stand united Local politics has no impact on foreign policy. There are many political parties in India. We have differences of opinion in domestic policy, but when it comes to foreign policy, we stand united,  he said.  Justin Trudeau is running a minority government. He is speaking his supporter's language.   He added.He also talked about India's policy on terrorism.  India's stand on terrorism is clear, there is no 'if-but' about terrorism policy in India. There are no shades of grey in terrorism. There is no religion, country, or sect of terrorism, terrorism is terrorism.  He added. The statement from the Punjab BJP President Sunil Jakhar came amid tensions in India-Canada relations after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday alleged that the Indian government was behind the fatal shooting of Hardeep Singh Nijjar.Nijjar, who was a designated terrorist in India, was gunned down outside a Gurdwara, in a parking area in Canada's Surrey, British Columbia on June 18.Justin Trudeau during a debate in the Canadian Parliament, claimed his country's national security officials had reasons to believe that  agents of the Indian government  carried out the killing of the Canadian citizen, who also served as the president of Surrey's Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara.The allegations made by the Canadian Prime Minister and foreign minister were rejected by the Ministry of External Affairs in India which dubbed the statements as absurd.  We have seen and rejected the statement of the Canadian Prime Minister in their Parliament, as well as the statement by their Foreign Minister. Allegations of the Government of India's involvement in any act of violence in Canada are absurd and motivated  the statement said. "

        "description": "The Asian Games, set to begin on Saturday in Hangzhou, China, will feature over 12,000 participants, more than the expected number for next year's Paris Olympics. The games will showcase a wide range of events, including regional specialties like dragon boat racing and kabaddi, as well as popular sports like cricket and squash. China is expected to dominate the medal table, followed by Japan and South Korea. The games will also see the participation of North Korea, which skipped the Tokyo Olympics due to border closures caused by the pandemic. ",
        "datePublished": "2023-09-21T16:21:00+05:30",
        "articleBody": "The Asian Games are an attention grabber. For starters, they involve more participants than the Summer Olympics. Organizers say more than 12,000 will be entered when the opening ceremony takes place Saturday in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou. This is more than the 10,500 expected for next year's Paris Olympics. The giant numbers are partly due to the staggering array of events with many regional specialties, sports, and games you won't find in the Olympics. And there's also cricket, which appears headed to the Olympics as soon as 2028 in Los Angeles, and certainly for 2032 in Brisbane, Australia. And there's squash, which has tried several times for Olympic recognition. The regional fare includes dragon boat racing, sepaktakraw - sometimes called  kick volleyball - wushu, a Chinese martial art, and kabaddi, a popular contact sport on the Indian subcontinent. There is also the non-Olympic martial art of ju-jitsu, and kurash, a form of wrestling popular in central Asia. To this, add a long list of what organizers call  mind sports  from bridge to chess to xiangqi (Chinese chess) to esports. Of course, there are the old standbys seen in every Olympics like track and field, swimming, or volleyball - and the usual grandiose opening and closing ceremonies. Nine sports will offer qualification spots for the Olympics - archery, artistic swimming, boxing, breaking, hockey, modern pentathlon, sailing, tennis, and water polo. However, most of the 481 events offer a chance for smaller delegations to win medals, which is often impossible at the Olympics. China won almost 300 overall medals at the last Asian Games in Indonesia in 2018. At the bottom of the table, Syria and Nepal won a lone medal each. Bhutan and Bangladesh were among nine delegations that didn't win any. China will dominate the medal table as it has for the last 40 years, followed by Japan and South Korea - Asia's other powers. The vast region stretches from Lebanon on the Mediterranean, through central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, to North Korea with organizers saying 45 nations or territories are entered. Organizers have said 191 participants from North Korea will be on hand. North Korea closed it border early in 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic and skipped the Tokyo Olympics, which were delayed a year until 2021. The Asian Games were also pushed back a year from 2022 because of the pandemic. According to South Korea's Unification Ministry, the last time North Korean athletes appeared in an international sports competition was January 2020, when North Korea competed in the Asian Football Confederation's under-23 soccer championship. If you like political intrigue, there may be plenty of it. The self-governing island of Taiwan will be on hand in China, which claims the democracy as a breakaway province that it has vowed to reclaim it. Known as the Republic of China, the island is officially listed as Chinese Taipei in the Olympics and Asian Games and marches under a white flag adorned with the Olympics rings. Its red, blue and white flag is in not allowed. Taiwan, with only 23.5 million, is a relative sports power in the region and finished seventh in the overall medal standings in Indonesia. The games also begin amid an open power struggle between International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach and Kuwait's Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, a long-time IOC member who is often described as the  kingmaker  who helped Bach win the IOC presidency in Buenos Aires in 2013. The Switzerland-based IOC openly intervened in July to invalidate the presidential election of the Olympic Council of Asia. It has also suspended Sheikh Ahmad from the IOC. The election was ostensibly won by Kuwait's Sheikh Talal Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, the younger brother of Sheikh Ahmad. The elder sheikh is the former 30-year president of the OCA, an organization that was created by his father. The IOC says it will continue to recognize Randhir Singh of India as interim president of the OCA until new elections are held. Bach will attend the opening ceremony in Hangzhou and is sure to have talks with Singh. The biggest event of the games might be a possible India vs. Pakistan gold-medal game in men's cricket on Oct. 7, which would be one of the most-watched global sports events all year. It comes just as cricket's world cup is also underway. China will again dominate diving, and several of China's top swimmers - fresh from the world championships two months ago in Fukuoka, Japan - will shine. The field in gymnastics is weakened since the world championships in Antwerp, Belgium, clash with the Asian Games. The biggest winner at the Asian Games might be South Korea esports star Lee Sang-hyeok, who is also known as  Faker.  If he wins gold he will be granted an exemption from military service. Tottenham Hotspur soccer forward Son Heung-min also bypassed a 21-month military stint because of a government exemption when South Korea won the gold medal in soccer at the 2018 games in Indonesia - although Son still had to do three months of basic training."

Singh appeared before the court during the proceedings of the case on Saturday. Delhi police will resume its arguments on September 23 on the charges against Singh. The Union Sports Ministry had constituted an oversight committee headed by Indian boxing great M C Mary Kom to investigate the allegations levelled by women wrestlers against Singh after their protest in the national capital.

        "articleBody": "New Delhi, Eleven ministries are yet to finalise their sector-specific accessibility guidelines for people with disabilities, the government said on Thursday. The information was shared by the Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry with the parliamentary standing committee on social justice and empowerment. The parliamentary panel report was tabled in Lok Sabha on Thursday.  The ministry said the departments of Law and Justice, Consumer Affairs and Telecommunication are following the guidelines of MEITY and MoHUA respective to their domain related to people with disabilities.   Other than this, five Ministries namely MoHUA, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Department of Sports have notified their guidelines in the official gazette and are currently underway of draft and final notification in The Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016 Rules,  the ministry told the parliamentary panel.  The ministry said that the  remaining eleven ministries are at various stages of finalisation of their respective sector-specific accessibility guidelines .  The Committee, in response, said it finds that while progress has been made in terms of framing Accessible India Campaign (AIC) specific guidelines, training, etc, yet the objectives of the scheme are far from being realised.   For instance, so far out of the 20 ministries/departments entrusted with the task of formulation of Sector Specific Standards of Accessibility, only nine ministries have done it so far and 11 are yet to finalise their guidelines,  the panel said.  The Committee said it would like to stress the fact that AIC seeks to build a truly inclusive and barrier-free environment for People with Disabilities (PwDs) and hence such a lackadaisical attitude of some of the government agencies is  very disheartening .  It urged the department to accord utmost priority to removing any impediments in the successful implementation of the scheme and to continuously remind the remaining departments to finalise their guidelines expeditiously in coordination with the Ministries/states/UTs so as to enable the PwDs to avail the intended benefits seamlessly  Also, the Committee, chaired by MP Rama Devi, said that it has recommended a proactive approach for the exemption of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on aids and appliances for PwDs as such an action would make aids and appliances more affordable.   The Committee is of the opinion that aids and appliances are essential items for persons with disabilities for their daily mobility to gain access to the opportunities of education, employment or enjoyment of other rights or the discharge of duties as responsible citizens,  it said.   Hence, the committee would like to reiterate their earlier recommendation and urge the Department to continue with sustained efforts to prioritise the removal of GST on aids and appliances, as without them many PwDs would be forced into living a restricted and confined life or in a state of seclusion,  the panel said."
